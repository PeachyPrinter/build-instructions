    <h3>Section 5 - Adding the Spring Force Magnets and Coils to the Mirror Assembly</h3>

    <div class="youwillneed">For this section you will need:
        <br>
        - Clear tubing
        <br>
        - Large square magnets
        <br>
        - Coils
        <br>
        - Both Mirror assemblies
        <br>
        - Utility knife
        <br>
        - Needle nose pliers
        <br>
        - spring force mounting plate
        <br>
        - permanent marker or pencil
        <br>
        <br>
    </div>

    <div id="step4-1" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section5/SFM+C-1-1.jpg'], this)">1. Using needle nose pliers, insert them into the clear tubing while closed and then open them to stretch the opening of the tube.
    </div>
    <div id="step4-2" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section5/SFM+C-2-1.jpg','images/section5/SFM+C-2-2.jpg'], this)">2. Insert the square magnets into the stretched end of the clear tubing so that the north and south poles are sideways, touching the walls of the tubing. If you inserted the magnets in the correct orientation, they should attract to each other through the walls of the tubing.
    </div>
    <div id="step4-3" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section5/SFM+C-3-1.jpg'], this)">3. Cut the clear tubing 3 cm (about 1&quot;) back from the stretched end.
    </div>
    <div id="step4-4" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section5/SFM+C-4-1.jpg'], this)">4. Repeat steps 2 - 4 until you have four 3 cm tubes with magnets inside them. *If your magnets do not attract like this, they are not positioned correctly*. We will now call these the spring force adjustment tubes.
    </div>
    <div id="step4-5" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section5/SFM+C-5-1.jpg','images/section5/SFM+C-5-2.jpg'], this)">5. Clip the mirror frame into the Spring Force Mounting Plate as you did in Step 1 of Section 1.
    </div>
<div id="step4-6" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section5/SFM+C-6-1.jpg','images/section5/SFM+C-6-2.jpg'], this)">6. Insert the non-magnet end of a spring force adjustment tube into the hole that extends off of the slot on the spring force mounting plate. The excess tube must extend off of the mounting plate in the opposite direction of the mirror assembly
    </div>
<div id="step4-7" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section5/SFM+C-7-1.jpg'], this)">7. Rotate the spring force adjustment tube until the face of the acetate arrow is level with the face of the mirror assembly frame. The dynamic damper arm must be extending away from the spring force adjustment tube.
    </div>
<div id="step4-8" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section5/SFM+C-8-1.jpg','images/section5/SFM+C-8-2.jpg'], this)">8. Using a marker or pencil, mark on the spring force adjustment tube the side that is closest to the thread assembly. Remove the spring force adjustment tube from the hole and glue the coil to the marked side centered directly on the magnet. Make sure that the coil is positioned so that the leads extend in the same direction as the excess tube coming off the magnet.
    </div>
<div id="step4-9" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section5/SFM+C-9-1.jpg','images/section5/SFM+C-9-2.jpg'], this)">9. Insert the spring force adjustment tube and coil back into the hole on the spring force adjustment plate. Your thing should look like this.
    </div>
<div id="step4-10" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section5/SFM+C-10-1.jpg','images/section5/SFM+C-10-2.jpg'], this)">10. Insert another spring force adjustment tube into the second hole on the mounting plate. If necessary, rotate the adjustment tube so the face of the acetate arrow is parallel with the face of the mirror assembly frame.
    </div>
<div id="step4-11" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/noimage.jpg'], this)">11. Repeat steps 5-10 on the other mirror assembly.
