The dampening system reduces the impact of vibrations on the printer caused by movements in the room during a print. The static dampers are small adjustable plastic pieces that get mounted in very close proximity to the dynamic dampers. A small drop of oil is placed in between the static and dynamic dampers, bridging the gap between the two parts and preventing most vibrations from effecting the precise movement of the galvonometers. Dampening is an essential part of the Peachys hardware, without it prints would often fail and rarely look good.
<br>
<br>
<b>Note:</b> Due to the fact that the dynamic damper tab is a protruding and moving part, and that the static damper must be mounted in such close proximity for the dampening system to work, it can often be the source of malfunction if it's not adjusted properly.  If during calibration or printing later on you notice that one of the galvonometers stops moving, it is likely that the dynamic damper tab is running into the static damper and needs to be re-adjusted.</div>

<br>
        <br>
Unfortunately, due to the design of the lasers we ordered, the focus ring must be glued to the threaded lens housing to lock it in place. If this is not done, the focus ring will often just spin on the threaded lens housing rather than gripping it and spinning the lens housing further into or out of the laser body itself. 
<br>
        <br>
 Adding an aperture limits the amount of light and the size of the beam leaving the laser allowing us to print thin and properly cured walls.

    <h3>Section 12 - Assembling the safety switch</h3>

    <div id="step11-00" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)"><b>Description:</b> In this section you'll be assembling and wiring the safety switch and the laser.  The safety switch will disable the laser if the outer protective housing is removed, or if the printer gets tipped over.  This adds yet another layer of safety to the Peachy Printer.
    </div>
    
    <div id="step11-01" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/parts-labelled.jpg'], this)"><b>For this section you will need:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>The Main Hanger</li>
        <li>4 Small Bolts</li>
        <li>4 Small Nuts</li>
        <li>Insulated wire</li>
        <li>Aluminum Foil</li>

    <p>Click to see an image of the parts labelled.</p>

    <div id="step11-1" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section12/SS-1-1.jpg'], this)">1. First we will make the Safety Switch Plate. Take the Acetate Pants and gently fold them making a shallow crease that continues the pre cut line at the end of the plastic. The crease should only go halfway up the pants, not all the way to the other end.
    </div>
    <div id="step11-2" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section12/SS-2-1.jpg'], this)">2. Push each leg of the acetate pants together slightly so their is a slight overlap, and tape it. It should make a shallow valley between the legs of the pants.
    </div>
    <div id="step11-3" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section12/SS-3-1.jpg'], this)">3. Tape a piece of Aluminum Foil to the inside of the valley covering the slit in the pants that you just taped. Leaving at least 3 inches (6.5cm) of extra Aluminum Foil extending off the edge without the holes in it.
    </div>
    <div id="step11-4" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section12/SS-4-1.jpg'], this)">4. Fold the extra Aluminum Foil around the underside of the valley and to the end of the pants so that it is covering the 2 holes.
    </div>
    <div id="step11-5" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section12/SS-5-1.jpg'], this)">5. Carefully poke a hole in the Aluminum Foil where the holes in the acetate pants are. We will now call this the safety switch plate.
    </div>
    <div id="step11-6" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section12/SS-6-1.jpg','app/images/section12/SS-6-2.jpg'], this)">6. Insert a small bolt in each hole in the safety switch plate so the head is sitting on the valley side of the Aluminum Foil. Cut away any extra Aluminum Foil. You can now set the safety switch plate aside.
    </div>
    <div id="step11-7" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">7. Take the piece of wire and cut it so you have 2 wires that are each 18 cm (10 inches) long.
    </div>
    <!--The following photos in this section are named improperly due to a step being taken out-->
    <div id="step11-8" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section12/SS-9-2.jpg'], this)">8. Strip 8 cm off of one end of one wire, and 1 cm (3/8 inch) off the other end of the same wire.
    </div>
    <div id="step11-9" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section12/SS-10-1.jpg'], this)">9. Strip 2 cm (3/4 inch) off of one end of the other wire, and 1 cm (3/8 inch) off the other end of the same wire.

    </div>
    <div id="step11-10" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section12/SS-11-1.jpg'], this)">10. Take the Main Hanger and insert one bolt into each of the holes on the side of the safety switch plate. Ensure that the bolt heads are sitting on the face opposite to the etchings.
    </div>
    <div id="step11-11" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section12/SS-12-1.jpg','app/images/section12/SS-12-2.jpg','app/images/section12/SS-12-3.jpg'], this)">11. Take the wire with the longest stripped end. Wrap the long striped piece of wire around the one of the bolts on the Main Hanger, then run it across the channel and wrap it around the bolt on the other side. Screw a nut onto each bolt, clamping the wire in place. Make sure the wire is mounted to the same side of the Main Hanger as the labelling.
    </div>
    <div id="step11-12" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section12/SS-13-1.jpg'], this)">12. Mount the safety switch plate to the main hanger by sticking the two bolts into the two closely spaced holes in the main hanger. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Note:</b> You should insert the bolts into the main hanger from the side opposite of the etchings. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Thread a nut onto one of the bolts tightening the safety switch in place.
    </div>
    <div id="step11-13" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section12/SS-14-1.jpg','app/images/section12/SS-14-2.jpg'], this)">13. Take the second wire (the 18cm wire with 1 cm of wire cut off one end and 2cm off the other) and wrap the longer stripped end around the other bolt on the safety switch plate, then screw a nut onto the bolt, pinching the wire into place. You should now have one remaining stripped end on each safety switch wire.
    </div>
    <div id="step11-14" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section12/SS-15-1.jpg'], this)">14. Strip about 5mm of the ends of both laser wires.
    </div>
    <div id="step11-15" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section12/SS-16-1.jpg'], this)">15. Take the end of a safety switch wire and wrap it around the bare end of one of the wires coming from the laser. Repeat this with the other safety switch wire, connecting it to the other laser wire. It does not matter which safety switch wire gets connected to which laser wire.
    </div>
    <div id="step11-16" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section12/SS-17-1.jpg'], this)">16. Insert the ground (black) wire end (with the other wire wrapped around it) into Port 5 on the circuit.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Note:</b> There is one more step to do before the laser and safety switch are completely hooked up.  We are leaving it incomplete at this point to ensure that there is no risk of the laser turning on while unguarded.  The laser and safety switch will be completed in a later section.

    <h3>Section 16 - Assembling the Drip system</h3>

    <div id="step16-00" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-29A-1.jpg'], this)"><b>Description:</b> In this section you'll be assembling the drip system. The drip system uses a siphoning action to drip saltwater from the top reservoir into the bottom reservoir raising the height of the resin. The microphone cables will be hooked up to the pieces of aluminum rod so it can detect when a drip occurs. By counting the number of drips the Peachy Printer is able to know what height the resin is currently at, so it knows what layer to print. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Recommendation:</b> If using our standard setup, we recommend using a lower reservoir with a maximum height of 6 cm.  If you can’t find anything of that size, cutting the bottom of an empty and clean milk or cream container to that height is an easy solution.  While we realize that our recommendation provides you with a very small build volume, we strongly suggest that you use it as a starting point.  Using a standard system make troubleshooting much easier.  In addition, We've yet to test large prints.  For that reason it's a good idea to start with what we know works, and right now that is prints less than 4 cm tall.
<br>
        <br>
        <b>Note:</b> You must choose reservoirs that have the same distance from wall to wall all the way up (walls that are not tapered).  If the reservoir is larger at the top than it is at the bottom, larger at the bottom than it is at the top, or larger in the middle than it is at the top or bottom it will not work.  
<br>
        <br>
You also must make sure that your upper reservoir is no larger than your lower reservoir.  In fact, it’s best if it is somewhat smaller to ensure that your lower reservoir will never overflow.

        <br>
        <b>Tip:</b> We found that glueing a large straw (larger than the clear tubing) up one wall of your reservoirs very well as an alternative, then you can simply slip the tubing into the straw and not have to worry about it falling out or not reaching near the bottom of the reservoir. This method may replace, or be used in combination with the hose hangers.

Put your outer housing back on (the drip feed hose should exit through the side of the outer housing where the notch is cut). Put the upper cardboard plate on the External housing, then place your upper reservoir on top. Place the hose hanger on the edge of your upper reservoir so that the drip feed is hanging down the outside of it.
    </div>
    <div id="step16-28a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-28A-1.jpg','app/images/section16/DF-28A-2.jpg','app/images/section16/DF-28A-3.jpg'], this)">28-A. Measure the distance between the end of the neon tube on the hose hanger to the bottom of your upper reservoir. Cut a piece of clear tubing to that length, stretch one end of it with your pliers and then slide it onto the neon tube on the end of the hose hanger (you may want to remove the hose hanger from the upper reservoir to connect the clear tubing).
    </div>
    <div id="step16-29a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-29A-1.jpg'], this)">29-A. You may now hang your drip feed from the upper reservoir (the clear tubing you just connected should reach the bottom of the upper reservoir).
    </div>
    <div id="step16-26b" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">26-B. The length of these clear tubing sections will depend on the size of your upper and lower reservoirs, as well as the total distance between the two reservoirs. Cut them to the appropriate length and then slide the two pieces of clear tubing over the neon tubing at the top and bottom of your drip feed.
    </div>
    <div id="step16-27b" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">27-B. You can now hang the top end of your drip feed in the upper reservoir, letting the drip feed run down into the lower reservoir. We recommend securing your drip feed to something solid on at least one point.

From the "shape" pull down menu, check that it is playing the &quot;square&quot; signal, and that laser power is checked to “on”. Take a close look at the mirrors, both mirrors should be slowly moving back and forth.  You should be able to see the laser beam moving around on the surface of your work area (it may not look like a true square yet but we will get to that later). If all these things are happening, well done!  This is a good sign your printer is working correctly.  If not, please go back to sections 11 and 12 to ensure that you've wired the coils, laser, and safety switch properly.  If you don't find the problem there, visit the beta tester forum for troubleshooting.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Note:</b> The Peachy Printer Team is on our <a href="http://forum.peachyprinter.com/" target="_blank">beta tester forum</a> ready to help, and since you’ve made it this far there might be other people who could use your help to!</div>
        <div id="section18-6" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg’], this)">6. Take your leftover clear hose and cut three pieces to a length of 2 cm. Insert the 3 tubes into the square hole in the wire mesh (as if they are legs of a tripod). This will be the base from which you print off of.  Set your print base aside. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Note:</b> You will want these pieces of hose to be as close to the same size as each other as possible so that your platform is even and does not wobble.  Don't use a 4 leg system as it is much more prone to wobbling, and may result in failed prints.</div>
        <div id="section18-7" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg’], this)">7. Mix your saltwater solution with 3 parts water and 1 part salt. Stir until it is completely dissolved. Set the saltwater aside.
<br>
            <br>
            <b>Note:</b> In an ideal mixture the water should be almost completely saturated with salt, and the resin should easily float on top of it.
            <br>
            <br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> We recommend making some extra salt water and keeping it in a resealable container.  If you don’t have a resealable container then we recommend that you come back to this step when you get to Section 20, Part B - Calibrating the Drip Feed.</div>

As you will see we have some specific adjustment spots on the circuit for this purpose.
<br>
            <br>
<b>Note:</b> If you start using a different computer to drive the printer after tuning the circuit, you will have to re-tune the circuit to the new computer.

        <li>The Peachy Printer with all cables connected to your computer and software installed</li>
        <li>A precision flathead screwdriver</li>
        <li>Voltmeter (optional)</li>

        <b>Note:</b> If you don’t have a voltmeter follow instruction set A, if you do have a voltmeter follow instruction set B (further down).
        <br>
    </p>

<h3>Instruction Set A - Without a Voltmeter</h3>

    <div id="section19-1a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">1A.  Unplug the two cables going to the USB ports on your computer.</div>
<div id="section19-2a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">2A. Remove the external housing, unmount the printer from the internal box, and set it down on the table. Disconnect the laser from the circuit before starting to avoid the hazards of the laser turning on. Connect the printer to your computer with the two power cables going to your computers USB ports, and the audio cable going to your computers headphone jack. </div>
<div id="section19-3a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">3A. Launch calibrate-main.py</div>
<div id="section19-4a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">4A. In the &quot;shape: pull down menu change the shape to &quot;center&quot;. Pull the audio jack out of your computer to check that the software is  playing a signal.  You should hear a high pitched tone, if so then plug the audio cable back in.</div>
<div id="section19-5a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">5A. Open your computer's advanced volume settings.  Ensure that the master volume is at 100% and that the individual program volume for the calibration app is at 100% as well.  
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Note:</b> Make sure that you never use gain.  Every time you use your printer, the volume settings must be the same as they were when you calibrated.</div>
<div id="section19-6a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">6A. Remove the coil lead from screw terminal 1 on the circuit, trace the lead back to the mirror assembly it comes from. Take a look at the mirror on that assembly and make note of its natural resting position. The surface of the mirror should be level with the surface of the mirror frame (if it's not you'll have to adjust it with the spring force adjustment tube).
<br>
<br>
<b>Tip:</b> Looking at a reference point in the reflection of the mirror before reconnecting the lead is a great way to tell how far the mirror moves when the coil gets power, and to see if you've adjusted it back to it's natural resting position.</div>
<div id="section19-7a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">7A. Reconnect the coil lead to screw terminal 1, then adjust VR1 until the mirror is in it's natural resting position (the same position it was when the lead was not connected).  
<br>
    <br>
<b>Note:</b> If adjusted perfectly, the mirror should not move at all when you momentarily make a connection by tapping the coil lead to screw terminal 1.  The more the mirror jumps the further it is away from being zeroed, so get it as close as you can (it doesn’t have to be perfect, but it shouldn't move much). When a printer's circuit is not zeroed to that specific computer, it may turn the laser off for a portion of it's path during a print, or the laser may never come on at all.</div>
<div id="section19-8a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">8A. Repeat with screw terminal 3, the other mirror assembly, and VR2.</div>

<h3>Instruction set B - with a voltmeter</h3>

<div id="section19-1b" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">1B.  Unplug the two cables going to the USB ports on your computer.</div>
<div id="section19-2b" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">2B. Remove the external housing, unmount the printer from the internal box, and set it down on the table.  Disconnect the laser from the circuit before starting to avoid the hazards of the laser turning on. Connect the printer to your computer with the two power cables going to your computer's USB ports, and the audio cable going to your computer’s headphone jack.</div>
<div id="section19-3b" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">3B. Launch calibrate.py</div>
<div id="section19-4b" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">4B. In the “shape: pull down menu change the shape to “center”. Pull the audio jack out of your computer to check that the software is playing a signal.  You should hear a high pitched tone, if so then plug the audio cable back in.</div>
<div id="section19-5b" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">5B. Open your computer’s advanced volume settings.  Ensure that the master volume is at 100% and that the individual program volume for the calibration app is at 100% as well.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Note:</b> Make sure you never have your volume over 100%, this should ensure that you’re not using gain in your sound system. Using gain will likely cause clipping of the audio signal that gets sent to the printer.  This will result in a print that is missing an entire portion of it’s wall.  Every time you use your printer, the volume settings must be the same.</div>
<div id="section19-6b" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">6B. Set your voltmeter to the 2 volt range (unless autoranging). 
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Note:</b> you might need to start on a higher range and then switch down to for more accuracy 2v. </div>
<div id="section19-7b" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">7B. Connect the black lead of your voltmeter to Test Point TP12 - you'll have to hold it here for the rest of this section. </div>
<div id="section19-1" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">8B. Connect the red lead of your voltmeter to Test Point TP5.  Adjust VR1 until the voltmeter reads in range between 0.000V - 0.050V.  The closer you can get to 0.000V the better. VR1 and TP5 effect screw terminal 1.
<br>
    <br>
<b>Note:</b> VR1 & 2 are 20 turn pots. That means they make 20 full rotations between their highest and lowest resistances. It is normal to turn the pot 5 times or more and see no change in voltage.  Keep turning, once you get in range the voltage will change quickly.</div>
        <div id="section19-1" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">9B. Move the red lead to Test Point TP6.  Adjust VR2 until the voltmeter reads in range between 0.000V - 0.050V. Note: The closer you can get to 0.000V the better. VR2 and TP6 effect screw terminal 3.</div>

        <h3>Part A - Calibrating the printer</h3>
        
    <div id="section20-0a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)"><b>Description:</b> Calibrating your printer will help account for discrepancies in centering, distance from the print area,  and physical differences between each printer. This process is required every time you change the printer height, change reservoirs, move the internal components of the printer (such as a hard bump or a fall), change computers, or change sound cards.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Note:</b> This section has no images yet.</div>
        
        <div id="section20-1a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">1A. Determine the height of your lower reservoir by measuring from the bottom of the inside of the reservoir up to the top of its walls. If you are using our default housing we recommend a lower reservoir with a maximum height of 6 cm.</div>
        
        <div id="section20-2a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">2A. Determine the maximum Z range (printable object height) for the reservoir you chose  - the distance between the print base level (the level at which you start a print) to the maximum height of your build volume.  You can do this by measuring the height of your wire mesh print base, and subtracting that from the height of your lower reservoir.  For example - 6 cm (height of lower reservoir) subtract 1 cm (height of print base) = 5 cm (maximum Z range)</div>
        
        <div id="section20-3a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">3A. Make sure that your sound card is set to maximum volume for the speaker.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Note:</b> Some sound cards have a boost feature, audio effects, and microphone feedback. Ensure that these features are off.</div>
        
        <div id="section20-4a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">4A. Mount the printer back onto the internal box by hooking the main hanger onto the internal box.</div>
        
        <div id="section20-5a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">5A. With your safety glasses on, open the calibration software.</div>

        <div id="section20-8a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">8A. Place your lower reservoir directly underneath the printer, inside the internal housing. Lay the calibration grid on top of your lower reservoir so that it’s sitting at the height you determined in Step 2 (the height of your lower reservoir).</div>
        
        <div id="section20-9a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">9A. Take the piece of extra elastic thread and tie a knot around the nut. You’ll use this as a miniature plumb bob to line the calibration grid up directly underneath the 2nd mirror on the printer.</div>
        
        <div id="section20-10a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">10A. Take the nut with the string attached and lay it down on the center of the calibration grid. Take the untied end of thread and route it up and around the mirror frame so that the thread is hanging overtop of the frame in a &quot;U&quot; shape.  The thread should hanging in line with the center of the mirror.</div>
        
        <div id="section20-11a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">11A. Pull the untied end of the thread down until the nut is hanging about 1mm above the calibration grid, suspended from the second mirror.</div>
        
        <div id="section20-12a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">12A. Move the calibration grid so that the center of the grid is lined up with the nut, but positioned about 5 mm behind it. </div>
        
        <div id="section20-13a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">13A. Use the spring force adjustment tubes to align the laser beam to hit dead center of the calibration grid. </div>
        
        <div id="section20-14a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">14A. Once you have the laser beam as close to center as you can get it, align the calibration grid so that the laser beam is hitting dead center on the grid.</div>
        
        <div id="section20-15a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">15A. In the calibration application from the <b>&quot;Shape&quot;</b> pull down menu select <b>&quot;Xline&quot;</b>. The printer should now be drawing a straight line back and forth along the X axis. Rotate the calibration grid so the laser path matches up with the gridlines.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Note:</b> Move the shape back and forth between Center and Xline to assure that the calibration grid stays centered underneath the second mirror after it’s been moved.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Troubleshooting Tip:</b> Due to the fact that the dynamic damper tab is a protruding and moving part, and that the static damper must be mounted in such close proximity for the dampening system to work, it can often be the source of malfunction if it’s not adjusted properly.  If you’re experiencing issues here, it’s likely that the dynamic damper tab is running into the static damper and needs to be re-adjusted.</div>
        
        <div id="section20-16a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">16A. In the calibration application from the <b>&quot;Shape&quot;</b> pull down menu select <b>&quot;Square&quot;</b>. Your printer should now be attempting to draw a square on the calibration grid.  It will most likely be quite warped.  This is normal, and is what the calibration app is for. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Troubleshooting Tip:</b> Depending on the size of square that the printer is drawing, a section of the square may appear to be missing.  This is likely because the printer is attempting to draw a square too large and the laser beam is actually being blocked by the mirror frame for a portion of it's path. This can be fixed with calibration.</div>
        
        <div id="section20-17a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">17A. Manipulate the values of the <b>"shear"</b> and <b>&quot;scale&quot;</b> tuning parameters to make the warped square a true square. Use the grid lines on the calibration grid as a reference to the correctness of the square. When finished, the 4 walls of the square should trace the lines on the calibration grid. You’ll need to make note of how large the square is, as you’ll have to re-create a square of the same size in a later step.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Tip:</b> Start with shear, and finish with scale. It's generally a good idea to scale down (this will fix the issue of the laser path being blocked by the mirror frame).</div>
        
        <div id="section20-18a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">18A. Measure the distance from the center to the edge of the square in millimeters and enter that in the &quot;Max position&quot; fields of the X and Y axis columns. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Note:</b> The light grey grid lines on the calibration paper are 2mm apart, and the dark grid lines are 1 cm apart.</div>
        
        <div id="section20-19a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">19A. Re-adjust the height of the calibration grid so that it is at the print base level (the height of your print base).  The simplest way to do this is to put the calibration grid on top of your print base.  If the calibration grid doesn’t fit inside your lower reservoir that is fine.  Remove your lower reservoir from underneath the printer and place the calibration grid on top of the print base directly on the surface of your work area.</div>
        
        <div id="section20-20a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">20A. Click the "<b>Add new calibration</b>" button and enter "<b>0.0</b>"</div>

        <div id="section20-22a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">22A. Align the calibration grid so that the laser beam is shining on the center point of the grid.</div>
        
        <div id="section20-23a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">23A. In the calibration application from the &quot;<b>Shape</b>&quot; pull down menu select &quot;<b>Xline</b>&quot; and rotate the paper to line up on that axis.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Note:</b> Move the shape back and forth between Center and Xline to assure that the calibration grid stays centered underneath the second mirror after it’s been moved.</div>
        
        <div id="section20-24a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">24A. In the calibration application from the <b>&quot;Shape&quot;</b> pull down menu select <b>&quot;Square&quot;</b>.</div>
        
        <div id="section20-25a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">25A. Reduce the X and Y scale values in the <b>“tuning parameters”</b> section until the size of the square that the printer is drawing is equal to the size of the square that was drawn in step 17. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Note:</b> Be sure that you don’t use the “<b>size</b>” field to adjust the size of the square as it’s a global variable and its value is not saved in each calibration file.</div>
        <div id="section20-26a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">26A. Click save and save your calibration file under the name <b>&quot;tuning.dat&quot;</b> 
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Note:</b> There is already a file named <b>&quot;tuning.dat&quot;</b> in the src directory.  Overwrite it with your new file.</div>
</div>

<h3>Part B - Calibrating the dripper</h3>

<div id="section20-0b" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)"><b>Description:</b> This step allows the software to determine the height of the print surface in your tank. This process must be completed every time you physically alter the dripper or change the lower reservoir.
<br>
<br>
<b>Note:</b> The drip rate affects the size of the drips by as much as 30%. This is an issue we plan to account for in the software by measuring the time between each drip and using that in a formula to calculate the drip size.  For now just be aware that it is still an issue.  Another possible solution is a solenoid valve which governs a consistently fast drip speed by turning it on or off.  Being that the Peachy Printer is a community project, feel free to get involved with the development of this feature by visiting the thread about it at <a href="http://3dprintboard.com/showthread.php?2194-Drip-Governor-A-most-valuble-first-hack" target="_blank">3Dprintboard.com</a>.</div>

<div id="section20-1b" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">1B. Ensure that your computer’s microphone levels are at 100% and no special effects or features are enabled (monitoring, etc). </div>

<div id="section20-2b" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">2B. Remove the lower reservoir from underneath the printer and put the external housing and top plate over the printer.</div>

<div id="section20-3b" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">3B. Fill your upper reservoir with salt water and place it on top of the printer. Hang the upper hose hanger of your drip feed on the rim of the upper reservoir.  Ensure that the end of the hose is submerged in the saltwater, and that the clamp ring valve at the top of the drip feed is opened enough to allow the salt water to flow through the hose.</div>

    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Note:</b> As the drips fall, they must simultaneously make contact with both aluminum rods inside the syringe on your drip feed.  If this is not happening, make sure the aluminum rods are aligned so that the upper rod is directly above the lower rod, and within a small enough distance that each drip can touch both rods for a fraction of time.</div>

<div id="section20-9b" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">9B. You should have feedback in the console showing the drips as they occur.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Troubleshooting tip:</b> If you can't see the drips being counted, a number of things could be going wrong.  The aluminum rods in the drip feed may not be lined up properly, or the wires on the dripper could be hooked up incorrectly or have a bad connection.  Check to ensure that these things are done correctly and if that doesn’t fix the problem, post in the forum for help.  If you'd like, see if others need help too!</div>

    <h3>Section 21 - Cure Time Calibration Print
        <br>
        <br>
        Congratulations!  You're about to do your first actual print :)</h3>
        
        <div id="section21-00" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)"><b>Description:</b> In this step you'll find the ideal cure time (or laser speed). This is done by printing a corner and various speeds and then examining the print to determine the best cure time. If the laser moves too slowly, the resin gets exposed to too much light, resulting in a print that is overcured. Overcuring can cause a print to have very rough walls and sometimes even fail if the resin isn't able to break it’s surface tension quick enough.  The ideal settings will result in a print that is still somewhat soft or squishy.  You can then fully cure the printer at a later time by setting it out in sunlight, or by using a curing station. This process must be done each time that the laser is changed, or when using different resin formulas (stiff, flex, wiggle).
<br>
            <br>
<b>Note:</b> Printing with PeachyJuice or MakerJuice Flex and Wiggle resins remains untested, so we recommend completing this section using PeachyJuice Stiff or MakerJuice SubG/SubG+ resin only.  If you'd like to be a part of testing how the Peachy Printer performs with the Wiggle and Flex resins, there will be a subforum for that mission soon!

        <b>Safety Note:</b> You must wear your safety glasses at all times
Resin Warning: The resin is a mild skin irritant.  To be safe while handling resin we recommend that you use latex gloves. Be sure not to rub your face or eyes after handling the resin. The resin can get quite hot when exposed to direct sunlight, so be extra careful to keep it away from your skin under sunlight. If the resin is cured too quickly, prints can actually shatter due to the pressure and tension created by the shrinking outer layer of resin. Once the resin is fully cured, it becomes inert and is no longer an irritant.  Be sure to wash your fully cured print with soap and water before handling with your bare hands. Click <a href="http://makerjuice.com/docs/SubG-MSDS.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> to read the full material safety data sheet.

    <div id="section21-1" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">1. Open the terminal and change directory into the source folder (src) in the Peachy Printer Tools folder, type <b>python exposure_test.py</b> and press <b>Enter</b> 
        <br>
        This will generate gcode for your cure time calibration print.</div>
        
        <div id="section21-2" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">2.

        <div id="section21-3" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">3. Remove your upper reservoir from the top of the external housing, and then remove the external housing.  Place your print base inside the lower reservoir,  Add some salt water to the lower reservoir, then add a small amount of resin on top of the salt water (just enough to completely cover the surface) by slowly pouring it down the side wall of the container (similar to how a beer would be poured).  Be sure that the surface level of the resin does not get above the wire mesh of your print base.   Put the lower reservoir inside the internal housing making sure the laser beam is hitting the center of the print base.You can now place the external housing back on, and the upper reservoir back on top of the printer.  Make sure that the drip feed still connects the two reservoirs.</div>
        
        <div id="section21-4" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">4. Open the drip valve and let the surface level of the resin rise. Close the valve off when the surface level of the resin is just below the wire mesh print base. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Note:</b> If the resin rises above the wire mesh print base, the print will not adhere to the base and your print will fail. This is because the laser light only cures approximately 0.1mm down into the resin.</div>
        
        <div id="section21-5" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">5. Ensure that your microphone setting on the computer is set to 100% and your volume is also at 100%.</div>

        <div id="section21-7" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">7. Slowly turn on the drip valve and monitor the feedback on the screen.  The print will start automatically once the software detects the first drip.</div>
        
        <div id="section21-8" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">8. If you set the drip rate to fast, the software will give you the following warning: “<b>Too fast:-------> X drips ahead</b>”.  If this happens re-adjust the clamp ring valve on the drip feed until the warning stops appearing. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Note:</b> A print generally won't fail until the dripper is running 100-200 drips ahead.  In fact, it doesn’t hurt to have the drip rate running 5-25 drips ahead at all times.</div>
        
        <div id="section21-9" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">9. You are now printing!  Watch and wait :)</div>
        
        <div id="section21-10" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">10. The software will notify you when the print is completely. Stop the drip feed completely. Remove the print from the lower reservoir by picking up the print base with a pair of tweezers. Be careful not to expose it to UV light (sunlight, grow lights, tanning beds) until after you’ve completed all the steps in this section.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Safety Note:</b> Be sure that you are wearing protective gloves when handling a fresh print.  Once the print is fully cured, you can wash it thoroughly with soap and water, and then it is safe to handle with bare hands.</div>
        
        <div id="section21-11" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">11. Set the print down and poke along it from top to bottom.  You’ll notice that it’s cured hard on one end, and soft on the other.  The ideal cure rate or laser speed will have taken place at the hardest (most cured) point that is still smooth.  Make a mark at this point.</div>
        
        <div id="section21-12" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">12. Measure the distance from the bottom of the print to the mark you made and subtract 3 mm from your measurement.  To calculate your ideal laser speed in mm/second take your measurement, multiply it by 50, and add 100. For example, if your print is cured properly at a height of 10mm your calculation would be 10 * 50 + 100 = 600(mm/second).</div>
        
        <div id="section21-13" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">13. Make note of this value as you will use it when generating your gcode. <b>Congratulations on your first print!</b></div>

    <h3>Section 22 - Using Cura to Generate Gcode</h3>

        <div id="section22-00" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)"><b>Description:</b> Gcode is what tells 3d printers where and when to move in order to print any given object.  Unlike other 3D printers, the Peachy Printer is driven by an audio signal, however that audio signal is created using the data from gcode.  The workflow is as follows: 
            <br>
            <br>
            3D model > .STL file > .gcode file > .gcode to .WAV > .WAV to printer
