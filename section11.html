    <h3>Section 11 - Hooking the Coils up to the Circuit</h3>

    <div id="step10-00" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section11/HC-C-4to8.jpg'], this)"><b>Description:</b> In this section you’ll be wiring the coil leads into the screw terminals on the circuit board. There is no soldering required, however if you are comfortable with soldering and would like to do so, it will provide you with a more reliable connection.

    <div id="step10-1" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/noimage.jpg'], this)">1. Take the piece of insulated wire and cut three pieces to a length of 12mm.  Strip one end of each piece of wire back half way.  Set the pieces of stripped wire aside.</div>
    <div id="step10-2a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/noimage.jpg'], this)">2-A. Take the coil leads and sand the coating off 1” back from the end of both wires. Sand gently about 25 strokes covering all &quot;sides&quot; of the wire while being careful not to break the wire.</div>
    <div id="step10-2b" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section11/HC-C-1B-1.jpg','images/section11/HC-C-1B-2.jpg'], this)">2-B. Take the coils leads and heat the end (1 &quot;) of both wires with a lighter so that the coating is removed. Be careful not to hold the flame too close, as it will melt the wire.</div>
    <div id="step10-3" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section11/HC-C-2-1.jpg'], this)">3. Take one lead wire off each coil and twist an inch of each of them around each other.</div>
    <div id="step10-4" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section11/HC-C-3-2.jpg'], this)">4. Take the 2 coil wires you just twisted together, and wrap them around the stripped wire.</div>
    <div id="step10-5" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section11/HC-C-4to8.jpg'], this)">5. Insert the stripped wire with the connected coil leads wrapped around it into Port 2 on the circuit, so that the coil wires are inserted into the port.</div>
    <div id="step10-6" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section11/HC-C-4to8.jpg'], this)">6. Take the other lead wire of one of the coils and wrap it around another stripped wire.</div>
    <div id="step10-7" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section11/HC-C-4to8.jpg'], this)">7. Repeat step 4 with the second coil on its own stripped wire.</div>
    <div id="step10-8" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section11/HC-C-4to8.jpg'], this)">8. Take one of the stripped wires with a single coil lead wire wrapped around it and insert it into port 1, so the coil wire itself is inserted inside the port.</div>
    <div id="step10-9" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section11/HC-C-4to8.jpg'], this)">9. Take the other stripped with with a coil lead wire wrapped around it and insert it into Port 3 so the coil wire itself is inserted inside the port.</div>
