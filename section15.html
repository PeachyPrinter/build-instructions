    <h3>Section 15 - Assembling the External Housing</h3>

    <div id="step14-00" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section15/EH-6-2.jpg'], this)">
        <b>Description:</b> In this section you’ll be assembling the external housing.  This external housing has a UV filtering see-through face, providing yet another layer of safety while still allowing you to observe what the printer is doing.  It also hangs the steel ball that sits on and activates the safety switch.
<br>
        <br>
<b>Note:</b> The some of the images for this section are very out of date, and many are missing. You’ll notice that the internal housing is made of cardboard, and is glued together.  This is of course no longer the case, however we left the images in as the pieces are still similar in other ways, and should be helpful regardless.
    </div>
    
    <div id="step14-01" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/parts-labelled.jpg'], this)"><b>For this section you will need:</b>
<br>
        <br>
        - The 3 External Housing Pieces (these will look similar to the internal housing pieces that were used in the previous step, but they are larger and have no tabs)
        <br>
        - The Internal Housing you assmebled in Step 14.
        <br>
        - Elastic Thread
        <br>
        - The Steel Ball 
        <br>
        - The large Orange Sheet
        <br>
        - Clear Tape (Scotch Tape)
        <br>
        - Cyanoacrylate glue (CA glue AKA superglue)
        <br>
        - Black duct tape (this is a temporary solution and will snap together in the future, duct tape is included in your kit)

    </div>

    <div id="step14-1" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/noimage.jpg’], this)">1. Take the widest of the 3 external housing pieces and lay it down on your workspace so that the rough side is facing up. 
    </div>

    <div id="step14-2" class="live"
onclick="set_images(['images/noimage.jpg’], this)">2. Place one piece of tape on each of the 4 corners so that half of each piece of tape is hanging off the side edges. 
    </div>

    <div id="step14-3" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/noimage.jpg’], this)">3. Stand the piece on it’s edge. Rotate it 180 degrees so that the smooth side of the plastic is facing towards you. This is going to be the back wall of the external housing.
    </div>

    <div id="step14-4" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/noimage.jpg’], this)">4. With your free hand grab one of the other external housing pieces and butt it’s edge up against the front face of the back wall so that the smooth side is facing inward, and the channel is on the bottom edge and closest to the front.
    </div>

    <div id="step14-5" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/noimage.jpg’], this)">5. Fold the extra tape sticking out off the back wall around the corner and onto the sidewall. Do this on both the top and the bottom pieces of tape. The two walls should now stand on their own.
    </div>

    <div id="step14-6" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section15/EH-4-1.jpg','images/section15/EH-6-1.jpg','images/section15/EH-6-2.jpg'], this)">6. Take the third and final external housing piece and repeat steps 4 & 5. The external housing should stand upright with the two side walls extending out at a 90 degree angle from the back wall, all the smooth sides should be facing inwards, and the two channels on the sidewalls should be on the bottom edge nearest the front.
    </div>

    <div id="step14-7" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section15/EH-1-1.jpg'], this)">7. Use CA glue to glue the steel ball to the end of 3 inches of elastic thread.
    </div>

    <div id="step14-8" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section15/EH-2-1.jpg','images/section15/EH-2-2.jpg','images/section15/EH-2-3.jpg','images/section15/EH-2-4.jpg'], this)">8. Put the elastic thread through the hole in the Orange Sheet so that the Steel Ball is on the inside of the existing fold, and tape the elastic thread so that the ball is hanging about 1 inch from the orange sheet. Cut off the excess elastic thread.
<br>
        <br>
<b>Note:</b> This is a very small hole, just large enough for the thread to go through.  If the whole isn’t big enough, poke it with the leftover carbon rod or something of similar size.
    </div>

    <div id="step14-9" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section15/EH-3-1.jpg','images/section15/EH-3-2.jpg'], this)">9. Fold the Orange Sheet along the dotted lines around the outer edges, so that the folds  point to the inside angle of the pre-existing fold.
    </div>
    <div id="step14-10" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section15/EH-5-1.jpg','images/section15/EH-5-2.jpg','images/section15/EH-5-3.jpg'], this)">10. Take the orange plastic sheet and use the extra black duct tape to tape the edges you folded in the previous step to the inside walls of the external housing so that it closes the top and front faces of the box. Your steel ball should be hanging from the back right corner of the box.
    </div>
    <div id="step14-11" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section15/EH-6-1.jpg','images/section15/EH-6-2.jpg'], this)">11. Slide the Outer housing over the Inner housing.
    </div>
    <div id="step14-12" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/noimage.jpg’], this)">12. Now test the safety switch, first make sure the safety switch is not touching the wire beneath when the steel ball is not on top of it. 
    </div>
    <div id="step14-13" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/noimage.jpg’], this)">13. Tip and shake the external housing, the steel ball should fall off the switch long before the printer tips to an angle where the laser could shine out of the housing.
