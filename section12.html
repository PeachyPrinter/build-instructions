    <h3>Section 12 - Assembling the safety switch</h3>

    <div id="step11-00" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/noimage.jpg’], this)"><b>Description:</b> In this section you’ll be assembling and wiring the safety switch and the laser.  The safety switch will disable the laser if the outer protective housing is removed, or if the printer gets tipped over.  This adds yet another layer of safety to the Peachy Printer.
    </div>
    
    <div id="step11-01" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/parts-labelled.jpg'], this)"><b>For this section you will need:</b>
        <br>
        - The Main Hanger
        <br>
        - 4 Small Bolts
        <br>
        - 4 Small Nuts
        <br>
        - Insulated wire
        <br>
        - Aluminum Foil
        <br>
        - Acetate Pants
        <br>
        - Clear Tape (Scotch tape)
        <br>
        <br>
        Click to see an image of the parts labelled.
        <br>
        <br>
    </div>

    <div id="step11-1" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section12/SS-1-1.jpg'], this)">1. First we will make the Safety Switch Plate. Take the Acetate Pants and gently fold them making a shallow crease that continues the pre cut line at the end of the plastic. The crease should only go halfway up the pants, not all the way to the other end.
    </div>
    <div id="step11-2" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section12/SS-2-1.jpg'], this)">2. Push each leg of the acetate pants together slightly so their is a slight overlap, and tape it. It should make a shallow valley between the legs of the pants.
    </div>
    <div id="step11-3" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section12/SS-3-1.jpg'], this)">3. Tape a piece of Aluminum Foil to the inside of the valley covering the slit in the pants that you just taped. Leaving at least 3 inches (6.5cm) of extra Aluminum Foil extending off the edge without the holes in it.
    </div>
    <div id="step11-4" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section12/SS-4-1.jpg'], this)">4. Fold the extra Aluminum Foil around the underside of the valley and to the end of the pants so that it is covering the 2 holes.
    </div>
    <div id="step11-5" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section12/SS-5-1.jpg'], this)">5. Carefully poke a hole in the Aluminum Foil where the holes in the acetate pants are. We will now call this the safety switch plate.
    </div>
    <div id="step11-6" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section12/SS-6-1.jpg','images/section12/SS-6-2.jpg'], this)">6. Insert a small bolt in each hole in the safety switch plate so the head is sitting on the valley side of the Aluminum Foil. Cut away any extra Aluminum Foil. You can now set the safety switch plate aside.
    </div>
    <div id="step11-7" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/noimage.jpg'], this)">7. Take the piece of wire and cut it so you have 2 wires that are each 18 cm (10 inches) long.
    </div>
    <!--The following photos in this section are named improperly due to a step being taken out-->
    <div id="step11-8" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section12/SS-9-2.jpg'], this)">8. Strip 8 cm off of one end of one wire, and 1 cm (3/8 inch) off the other end of the same wire.
    </div>
    <div id="step11-9" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section12/SS-10-1.jpg'], this)">9. Strip 2 cm (¾ inch) off of one end of the other wire, and 1 cm (3/8 inch) off the other end of the same wire.

    </div>
    <div id="step11-10" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section12/SS-11-1.jpg'], this)">10. Take the Main Hanger and insert one bolt into each of the holes on the side of the safety switch plate. Ensure that the bolt heads are sitting on the face opposite to the etchings.
    </div>
    <div id="step11-11" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section12/SS-12-1.jpg','images/section12/SS-12-2.jpg','images/section12/SS-12-3.jpg'], this)">11. Take the wire with the longest stripped end. Wrap the long striped piece of wire around the one of the bolts on the Main Hanger, then run it across the channel and wrap it around the bolt on the other side. Screw a nut onto each bolt, clamping the wire in place. Make sure the wire is mounted to the same side of the Main Hanger as the labelling.
    </div>
    <div id="step11-12" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section12/SS-13-1.jpg'], this)">12. Mount the safety switch plate to the main hanger by sticking the two bolts into the two closely spaced holes in the main hanger. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Note:</b> You should insert the bolts into the main hanger from the side opposite of the etchings. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Thread a nut onto one of the bolts tightening the safety switch in place.
    </div>
    <div id="step11-13" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section12/SS-14-1.jpg','images/section12/SS-14-2.jpg'], this)">13. Take the second wire (the 18cm wire with 1 cm of wire cut off one end and 2cm off the other) and wrap the longer stripped end around the other bolt on the safety switch plate, then screw a nut onto the bolt, pinching the wire into place. You should now have one remaining stripped end on each safety switch wire.
    </div>
    <div id="step11-14" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section12/SS-15-1.jpg'], this)">14. Strip about 5mm of the ends of both laser wires.
    </div>
    <div id="step11-15" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section12/SS-16-1.jpg'], this)">15. Take the end of a safety switch wire and wrap it around the bare end of one of the wires coming from the laser. Repeat this with the other safety switch wire, connecting it to the other laser wire. It does not matter which safety switch wire gets connected to which laser wire.
    </div>
    <div id="step11-16" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section12/SS-17-1.jpg'], this)">16. Insert the ground (black) wire end (with the other wire wrapped around it) into Port 5 on the circuit.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Note:</b> There is one more step to do before the laser and safety switch are completely hooked up.  We are leaving it incomplete at this point to ensure that there is no risk of the laser turning on while unguarded.  The laser and safety switch will be completed in a later section.
