    <h3>Section 4 - Mounting the Thread Assemblies to the Mirror Frames</h3>

    <div class="youwillneed">For this section you will need:
        <br>
        - Both Thread Assemblies
        <br>
        - Both Mirror Frames
         <br>
        - Both mirrors
        <br>
        - Cyanoacrylate Glue
        <br>
        - Utility Knife
        <br>
        <br>
    </div>

    <div id="step3-1" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section4/MA-1-1.jpg'], this)">1. Lay the mirror assembly frame down so that the arrows are facing up. Then take and lay the thread assembly across the top of the frame with the side without the magnets butted up against the inside edge of the mirror assembly frame on the side with the opening.
    </div>

    <div id="step3-2" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section4/MA-2-1.jpg','images/section4/MA-2-2.jpg','images/section4/MA-2-3.jpg','images/section4/MA-2-4.jpg'], this)">2. Take the thread extending off the side of the thread assembly without the mirrors and lace it through the center notch on the edge of the mirror assembly frame, then lace the thread around the upper and lower notches multiple times to lock it in place. Make sure the acetate arrow is butted up against the mirror frame. Apply glue to the elastic thread where it wraps around the upper notch and then cut off the excess thread.
    </div>

    <div id="step3-3" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section4/MA-3-1.jpg'], this)">3. Pinch the thread on the magnet side of the Thread Assembly and pull it across and into the center notch on the other edge of the Mirror Assembly frame. Ensure that the magnets are centered at the dashes in between the two mounting points on the outer edges of the mirror assembly frame.</div>

    <div id="step3-4" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section4/MA-4-1.jpg'], this)">4. Repeat the same process of wrapping the thread around the mirror assembly as shown in step 2. Cut off any excess thread. Once finished the thread assembly should rotate freely. Your mirror assembly should look like the last image ine the set.
    </div>
    <div id="step3-5" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section4/MA-5-1.jpg','images/section4/MA-5-2.jpg'], this)">5. Fold the dynamic damper plate out 90 degrees so that it protrudes to the side opposite of the magnets.
    </div>
    <div id="step3-6" class="live" onclick="set_images(['images/section4/MA-6-1.jpg'], this)">6. Remove the film from the back of the mirror and place the mirror onto its mounting spot on the acetate arrow so it is on the same side as the magnets. We will now refer to this as the Mirror Assembly.
