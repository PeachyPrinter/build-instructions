    <h3>Section 7 - Assembling and Oiling the Static Dampers</h3>
   
    <div id="step6-00" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section7/SD-7-4.jpg'], this)"><b>Description:</b> In this section you'll be assembling, mounting, and applying oil to the dampening system. The dampening system reduces the impact of vibrations on the printer caused by movements in the room during a print. The static dampers are small adjustable plastic pieces that get mounted in very close proximity to the dynamic dampers. A small drop of oil is placed in between the static and dynamic dampers, bridging the gap between the two parts and preventing most vibrations from effecting the precise movement of the galvonometers. Dampening is an essential part of the Peachys hardware, without it prints would often fail and rarely look good.
<br>
<br>
<b>Note:</b> Due to the fact that the dynamic damper tab is a protruding and moving part, and that the static damper must be mounted in such close proximity for the dampening system to work, it can often be the source of malfunction if it's not adjusted properly.  If during calibration or printing later on you notice that one of the galvonometers stops moving, it is likely that the dynamic damper tab is running into the static damper and needs to be re-adjusted.</div>

    <div id="step6-01" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/parts-labelled.jpg'], this)"><b>For this section you will need:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Male Static Damper Connector</li>
        <li>Female Damper Connector</li>
        <li>The L bracket with both mirror assemblies mounted.</li>
        <li>Oil dripper</li>
        <li>Carbon rod (leftover from making thread assemblies)</li>
    </div>
    <p>Click to see an image of the parts labelled.</p>

    <div id="step6-1" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section7/SD-1-1.jpg','app/images/section7/SD-1-2.jpg'], this)">1. Take a Male Static Damper Connector and insert it into the slider channel in the L bracket so that the male end points toward the Spring force magnet holder (static magnet holder)</div>
    <div id="step6-2" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section7/SD-2-1.jpg','app/images/section7/SD-2-2.jpg','app/images/section7/SD-2-3.jpg'], this)">2. Clip the Female Damper Connector onto the Male Damper Connector so that the acetate arrow is inside the arch on the Female Damper Connector.</div>
    <div id="step6-3" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section7/SD-3-1.jpg','app/images/section7/SD-3-2.jpg'], this)">3. Take a Male Static Damper Connector and insert it into the slider channel in the Static damper mount B (Mirror frame mount B) so that the male end points toward the Spring force magnet holder (static magnet holder)</div>
    <div id="step6-4" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section7/SD-4-1.jpg','app/images/section7/SD-4-2.jpg'], this)">4. Clip the Female Damper Connector onto the Male Damper Connector so that the acetate arrow is inside the arch on the Female Damper Connector.</div>
    <div id="step6-5" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">5. Make sure the Dynamic Damper Tab is lifted on the acetate arrow and pointing up at 90 degrees.</div>
    <div id="step6-6" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section7/SD-6-1.jpg'], this)">6. Adjust the Female Damper Connector so that it is almost touching the Dynamic damper tab on the acetate arrow (less than 1mm away, but not touching it).</div>
    <div id="step6-7" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section7/SD-7-1.jpg','app/images/section7/SD-7-2.jpg','app/images/section7/SD-7-3.jpg','app/images/section7/SD-7-4.jpg'], this)">7. Using the carbon rod apply a very small dab of oil in between each of the Female Static Damper Connectors and the Dynamic Dampers, making sure not to drip oil elsewhere on your printer. </div>
