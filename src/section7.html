    <h3>Section 7 - Assembling and Oiling the Static Dampers</h3>
   
    <div id="step6-00" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section7/SD-7-4.jpg'], this)"><b>Description:</b> In this section you'll be assembling, mounting, and applying oil to the dampening system. The dampening system reduces the impact of vibrations on the printer caused by movements in the room during a print. The static dampers are small adjustable plastic pieces that get mounted in very close proximity to the dynamic dampers. A small drop of oil is placed in between the static and dynamic dampers, bridging the gap between the two parts and preventing most vibrations from effecting the precise movement of the galvonometers. Dampening is an essential part of the Peachys hardware, without it prints would often fail and rarely look good.
<br>
<br>
<b>Note:</b> Due to the fact that the dynamic damper tab is a protruding and moving part, and that the static damper must be mounted in such close proximity for the dampening system to work, it can often be the source of malfunction if it's not adjusted properly.  If during calibration or printing later on you notice that one of the galvonometers stops moving, it is likely that the dynamic damper tab is running into the static damper and needs to be re-adjusted.

        <li>2 Riser Pads</li>
        <li>The L bracket with both mirror assemblies mounted</li>
        <li>Oil Tube</li>

Take a Female Static Damper and apply a drop of glue centered directly above the round cut out on the end.  Take a Riser Pad and place it on the drop of glue white side down.  Be sure that the Riser pad is in the center of the round cut out and right up against the edge.</div>
    <div id="step6-2" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section7/s7-2.1.jpg','app/images/section7/s7-2.2.jpg','app/images/section7/s7-2.3.jpg'], this)">2. Put a drop of glue on the surface of the Riser Pad. Take a Static Damper Disc and place it on the Riser Pad.  Ensure that the Damper Disc is centered on the Riser Pad.</div>
    <div id="step6-3" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">3. Repeat steps 1-2 with the other Female Damper Connector.</div>
    <div id="step6-4" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">4. Make sure the Dynamic Damper Tab is lifted on both acetate arrows and pointing up at 90 degrees.</div>
    <div id="step6-5" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section7/s7-5.1.jpg','app/images/section7/s7-5.2.jpg'], this)">5. Take a Male Static Damper Arm and insert it into the slider channel in the L bracket so that the male end points toward the Spring force magnet holder.</div>
    <div id="step6-6" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section7/s7-6.1.jpg','app/images/section7/s7-6.2.jpg','app/images/section7/s7-6.3.jpg'], this)">6. Clip the Female Damper Arm onto the Male Damper Arm so that the acetate arrow is inside the arch on the Female Damper Arm and the Dynamic Damper Tab is near the Static Damper Disc.</div>
    <div id="step6-7" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section7/s7-7.1.jpg','app/images/section7/s7-7.2.jpg'], this)">7. Take a Male Static Damper Arm and insert it into the slider channel in the Static damper/Mirror frame mount B so that the male end points toward the Spring force magnet holder.</div>
    <div id="step6-8" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section7/s7-8.1.jpg','app/images/section7/s7-8.2.jpg','app/images/section7/s7-8.3.jpg'], this)">8. Clip the Female Damper Arm onto the Male Damper Arm so that the acetate arrow is inside the arch on the Female Damper Arm and the Dynamic Damper Tab is near the Static Damper Disc.</div>
        <div id="step6-9" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section7/s7-9.1.jpg'], this)">9. Adjust both of the Female Damper Arms so that the Dynamic damper tab on both acetate arrows is almost touching the surface of both Static Damper Discs (less than 1mm away, but not touching it).</div>
        <div id="step6-10" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section7/s7-10.1.jpg'], this)">10. Cut the Oil tube open with a the utility knife.</div>
        <div id="step6-11" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section7/s7-11.1.jpg','app/images/section7/s7-11.2.jpg','app/images/section7/s7-11.3.jpg','app/images/section7/s7-11.4.jpg'], this)">11. Using a fine-tipped object (toothpick, long pin, precision flathead screwdriver, etc) apply a very small dab of oil in between each of the Static Damper Discs and the Dynamic Dampers, making sure not to drip oil elsewhere on your printer.  Itâ€™s important that the oil is making contact with both the Dynamic Damper Tab and the Static Damper Disc, but that neither of the parts are actually touching each other.</div>
