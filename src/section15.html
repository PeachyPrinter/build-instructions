        <b>Safety Note:</b> This section of the instructions requires the laser to be on and unguarded. Everyone within line of sight of the printer should be wearing the UV protective glasses provided. If you have pets, make sure they are out of the room. Remember, you can't see the UV light very well. Even a very bright UV light will appear fairly dim to the human eye unless its shining on a phosphorescent surface. It is possible for other sounds from your computer to turn the laser on (music, notifications, etc) so ensure that all other sounds are muted when using your Peachy Printer.
