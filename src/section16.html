    <h3>Section 16 - Assembling the Drip system</h3>

    <div id="step16-00" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-29A-1.jpg'], this)"><b>Description:</b> In this section you'll be assembling the drip system. The drip system uses a siphoning action to drip saltwater from the top reservoir into the bottom reservoir raising the height of the resin. The microphone cables will be hooked up to the pieces of aluminum rod so it can detect when a drip occurs. By counting the number of drips the Peachy Printer is able to know what height the resin is currently at, so it knows what layer to print. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Recommendation:</b> If using our standard setup, we recommend using a lower reservoir with a maximum height of 6 cm.  If you can’t find anything of that size, cutting the bottom of an empty and clean milk or cream container to that height is an easy solution.  While we realize that our recommendation provides you with a very small build volume, we strongly suggest that you use it as a starting point.  Using a standard system make troubleshooting much easier.  In addition, We've yet to test large prints.  For that reason it's a good idea to start with what we know works, and right now that is prints less than 4 cm tall.
<br>
        <br>
        <b>Note:</b> You must choose reservoirs that have the same distance from wall to wall all the way up (walls that are not tapered).  If the reservoir is larger at the top than it is at the bottom, larger at the bottom than it is at the top, or larger in the middle than it is at the top or bottom it will not work.  
<br>
        <br>
You also must make sure that your upper reservoir is no larger than your lower reservoir.  In fact, it’s best if it is somewhat smaller to ensure that your lower reservoir will never overflow.

Take the Hollow Aluminum Rod and cut it in half using the wire cutter on the needle nose pliers. Use the end of the needle nose pliers to pinch one end shut. Then make sure the other three remain open.
    </div>
    
    <div id="step16-2" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-2-1.jpg'], this)">2. Take the rod with the closed end and file the points on both creased edges of the closed end. Once finished, the closed end should be no wider than the rest of the rod.
    </div>
    
    <div id="step16-3" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-3-1.jpg','app/images/section16/DF-3-2.jpg'], this)">3. Take the rod with the closed end and file nearly halfway through the aluminum rod creating a small hole positioned in the middle of the rod. Be careful not to bend the rod.
    </div>
    
    <div id="step16-4" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-4-1.jpg','app/images/section16/DF-4-2.jpg'], this)">4. Disassemble the syringe. take the black plunger gasket and poke a hole (smaller than the aluminum rod) in the center of the peak.
    </div>
    
    <div id="step16-5" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-5-1.jpg','app/images/section16/DF-5-2.jpg'], this)">5. Cut four 1 cm pieces of neon tubing. Take one and insert it into the plunger, put the others aside for now.
    </div>
    
    <div id="step16-6" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-6-1.jpg'], this)">6. Take the Rod with 2 open ends and push it through the Neon Tubing and the Plunger so the Plunger is near the middle of the Rod.
    </div>
    
    <div id="step16-7" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-7-1.jpg'], this)">7. Insert the Rod and Plunger into the large opening of the syringe.
    </div>
    
    <div id="step16-8" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-8-1.jpg'], this)">8. Take the Rod with a closed end and push the closed end into the small hole. (where a needle normally goes) You might need to file the edges of the aluminum rod more to get it to fit into the syringe, but make sure it is still closed. The hole you filed in the side must be inside the syringe. Water needs to flow through this hole from within the syringe so it must not be blocked.
    </div>
    
    <div id="step16-9" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-9-1.jpg'], this)">9. Take a second piece of 1 cm neon tubing and slide it onto the excess aluminum tube that is extending from the bottom hole in the syringe. Push it all the way up so that it climbs over and covers the end of the syringe.
    </div>
    
    <div id="step16-10" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-10-1.jpg','app/images/section16/DF-10-2.jpg','app/images/section16/DF-10-3.jpg'], this)">10. Take the Audio Jack and cut off one end, then strip about 4 inches off the end. Cut off the insulating thread.
    </div>

    <div id="step16-11" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-11-1.jpg'], this)">11. Burn or sand off the protective coating on the ends of all three wires, being careful not to melt the wires. 
    </div>

    <div id="step16-12" class="live"
         onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-12-1.jpg'], this)">12. Twist the red and blue wires together.
    </div>

    <div id="step16-13" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-13-1.jpg'], this)">13. Take the red and blue wires and wrap it around one of the larger bolts, right near the head. Thread a nut all the way onto the bolt till it snugly clamps the wire in place.
    </div>

    <div id="step16-14" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-14-1.jpg'], this)">14. Repeat step 13 with the remaining wire from the audio cable and another bolt/nut.
    </div>

    <div id="step16-15" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-15-1.jpg'], this)">15. Take two clamp rings and thread one onto each of the bolts just a couple of turns.
    </div>

    <div id="step16-16" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-16-1.jpg'], this)">16. Take your Syringe and push the rod with the rubber plunger in until less than 1mm away from the other aluminum rod.
    </div>

    <div id="step16-17" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-17-1.jpg'], this)">17. Take both of the Clamp Rings (with wires) and clamp one on each end of the aluminum rods extending out of the top and bottom ends of the syringe. It does not matter which clamp goes on which end. Be very careful not to crush the aluminum rod by over tightening the clamp.
    </div>

    <div id="step16-18" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-18-1.jpg'], this)">18. Take another 1cm piece neon tubing and put it on the rod coming out of the bottom of the syringe, so it buts up against the Clamp Ring.
    </div>

    <div id="step16-19" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-19-1.jpg','app/images/section16/DF-19-2.jpg','app/images/section16/DF-19-3.jpg','app/images/section16/DF-19-4.jpg','app/images/section16/DF-19-5.jpg'], this)">19. Cut a two 10 cm pieces of neon tubing. Take one of them and make an angle cut on the end of the hose so that a Clamp ring can be slid over it. Use the pliers to pull the neon tubing through the clamp ring 1 cm beyond the angle cut. Then trim off the angle piece leaving at least 1 cm of neon tubing.
    </div>

    <div id="step16-20" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-20-1.jpg','app/images/section16/DF-20-2.jpg','app/images/section16/DF-20-3.jpg'], this)">20. Apply glue all the way around the outer edge of the Hose Hanger and glue it to the middle of the neon tubing with the clamp on it. It’s important that the hose is glued well enough that it follows the curve of the Hose Hanger.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Tip:</b> We found that glueing a large straw (larger than the clear tubing) up one wall of your reservoirs very well as an alternative, then you can simply slip the tubing into the straw and not have to worry about it falling out or not reaching near the bottom of the reservoir. This method may replace, or be used in combination with the hose hangers.
    </div>

    <div id="step16-21" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-21-1.jpg'], this)">21. Move the clamp so that it is at the end of the Hose Hanger.
    </div>

    <div id="step16-22" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-20-1.jpg','app/images/section16/DF-20-2.jpg','app/images/section16/DF-20-3.jpg'], this)">22. Repeat step 20 with the remaining 10cm piece of tubing so that you have another hose hanger (this one doesn't need a clamp).
    </div>

    <div id="step16-23" class="live"
         onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-23-1.jpg'], this)">23. Slide the end of the neon tube with the clamp on it onto the aluminum rod sticking out of the top of the syringe. Be sure their is space between the rod in the tube, and where the O clamp on the neon tube starts, so the O clamp does not pinch the rod inside the tube.
    </div>

    <div id="step16-24" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-24-1.jpg'], this)">24. Take the outer housing off of your printer and slide your lower reservoir into the internal housing so that it sits directly below the laser assembly.
    </div>
    <div id="step16-25" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">25. You must now cut two sections of clear hose to make each end of your drip system reach into the upper and lower reservoirs. If you are sticking with our default printer setup, then follow step 26-A. If you are making your own custom reservoir setup, Follow step 26-B.
    </div>
    <div id="step16-26a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-26A-1.jpg','app/images/section16/DF-26A-2.jpg','app/images/section16/DF-26A-3.jpg','app/images/section16/DF-26A-4.jpg'], this)">26-A. Take the clear tubing and cut it to a length of 18 inches. Use your needle nose pliers to stretch both ends so it’s easier to slide onto the neon tubing. Slide the clear hose over the neon tubing on the bottom of the syringe, and then take your 2nd hose hanger and slide one end of the neon tubing into the bottom of the clear tubing. You can now place the Bottom end of the drip feed inside your lower reservoir.
    </div>
    <div id="step16-27a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-27A-1.jpg','app/images/section16/DF-27A-2.jpg','app/images/section16/DF-27A-3.jpg'], this)">27-A. Put your outer housing back on (the drip feed hose should exit through the side of the outer housing where the notch is cut). Put the upper cardboard plate on the External housing, then place your upper reservoir on top. Place the hose hanger on the edge of your upper reservoir so that the drip feed is hanging down the outside of it.
    </div>
    <div id="step16-28a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-28A-1.jpg','app/images/section16/DF-28A-2.jpg','app/images/section16/DF-28A-3.jpg'], this)">28-A. Measure the distance between the end of the neon tube on the hose hanger to the bottom of your upper reservoir. Cut a piece of clear tubing to that length, stretch one end of it with your pliers and then slide it onto the neon tube on the end of the hose hanger (you may want to remove the hose hanger from the upper reservoir to connect the clear tubing).
    </div>
    <div id="step16-29a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section16/DF-29A-1.jpg'], this)">29-A. You may now hang your drip feed from the upper reservoir (the clear tubing you just connected should reach the bottom of the upper reservoir).
    </div>
    <div id="step16-26b" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">26-B. The length of these clear tubing sections will depend on the size of your upper and lower reservoirs, as well as the total distance between the two reservoirs. Cut them to the appropriate length and then slide the two pieces of clear tubing over the neon tubing at the top and bottom of your drip feed.
    </div>
    <div id="step16-27b" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">27-B. You can now hang the top end of your drip feed in the upper reservoir, letting the drip feed run down into the lower reservoir. We recommend securing your drip feed to something solid on at least one point.
