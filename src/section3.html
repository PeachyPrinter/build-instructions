    <h3>Section 3 - Assembling the Mirror Assembly & Magnetic Damping System</h3>
      <div id="step2-00" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/s3.jpg'], this)"><b>Description:</b> In this section you will be attaching the mirrors, magnets, and elastic thread to the a small plastic connector piece we call the acetate arrow, mounting it to the mirror frame, and assembling the magnetic damper.  These components when put together make up the Peachy Printer’s galvonometers.  Click to see an image of what you'll be completing in this section.

    <div id="step2-01" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/parts-labelled.jpg'], this)"><b>For this section you will need:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Elastic thread - <b>Note:</b> the thread is wrapped around the mirror frame.</li>
        <li>2 Acetate Arrows - <b>Note:</b> This is a very small piece of orange plastic, there is no difference between the two arrows.
        </li>
        <li>The magnets (2 small, 2 medium (square), 2 large (square))- <b>Note:</b> In this section you’ll be using all 3 sizes of magnets.  The smallest of which are extremely small and easy to lose.  We recommend leaving them stuck to the large magnets until you need them so they do not get lost.</li>
        <li>2 Small Aluminum Cylinders</li>
          <li>2 Coils</li>
        <li>2 Mirrors (Leave the protective film on the surface of the mirrors)</li>
          <li>2 Mirror Frames</li>
          <li>2 Spring Force Magnet Holders <b>Note:</b> These look identical to the Damper Magnet Holders.  The only difference is that the magnet slots fit the medium square magnets.</li>
          <li>2 Damper Magnet Holders <b>Note:</b> These look identical to the Spring Force Magnet Holders.  The only difference is that the magnet slots fit the large square magnets.</li>
          <li>Utility Knife</li>
          <li>Ruler</li>
          <li>Permanent Marker</li>
        <li>Fine-tip Metal tweezers</li>
        <li>CA Glue</li>
      </ul>

    <div id="step2-1" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/s3-1.1.jpg','app/images/section3/s3-1.2.jpg'], this)">1. Cut the elastic thread to a length of 4cm.  This will ensure that when the elastic thread is stretched around the mirror frame it has the correct amount of tension.
    </div>

    <div id="step2-2" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/s3-2.jpg'], this)">2.  Tie the thread through the hole at each end of the acetate arrow ensuring that the marks you made are near the knots at each end.
    </div>

    <div id="step2-3" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/s3-3.jpg'], this)">3.  Cut the excess thread off close to the knot.
    </div>

    <div id="step2-4" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/s3-4.jpg'], this)">4.  Loop the thread tied to the acetate arrow around the mirror frame, then stretch it around the nub nearest the open end of the mirror frame on the side opposite of the coil slot.  Ensure that the mirror mounting spot on the acetate arrow is also nearest the open end of the mirror frame.  The acetate arrow should now be suspended across the mirror frame.
    </div>

    <div id="step2-5" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/s3-5.1.jpg','app/images/section3/s3-5.2.jpg'], this)">5.  Using a utility knife, cut the small nub off of the aluminum cylinder so that it’s face is flat.
    </div>

    <div id="step2-6" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/s3-6.jpg'], this)">6.  Insert the aluminum cylinder into the rectangular hole in the middle of the acetate arrow.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Note:</b> Be careful here, it is easy to use too much force and break the acetate arrow.  In the case that this does happen, we’ve sent you 2 extra acetate arrows.
        <br>
        <br>
    </div>
      <div id="step2-7" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/s3-7.jpg'], this)">7.  Insert the coil into the coil mounting slot on the mirror frame.
    </div>
      <div id="step2-8" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">8.  Take 2 of the small magnets and stack them, they will naturally want to do this.
    </div>
      <div id="step2-9" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">9. Pinch the smaller magnets in between the tweezers tips. While doing so, use your fingernail to split the smaller magnets, making sure they are still aligned in a way they are attracted to each other, so that one magnet is on each tip of the tweezers.
    </div>
      <div id="step2-10" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/s3-10.1.jpg','app/images/section3/s3-10.2.jpg'], this)">10. Pinch the magnet tab on the acetate arrow with the tweezers so that there is one magnet on each side.  Slide the tweezers away while using your thumb and forefinger to hold the magnets in place. One magnet should remain on each side of the magnet tab, inside the ring of holes indicating the spot for the magnets.
          <br>
        <br>
        <b>Note:</b> If you find this method difficult you can try a different way:  Repeat step 2, then pick the magnets up with your tweezer tips.  Use your thumb to push the magnets down onto the magnet tab so that the tab slides in between the two magnets leaving one on either side of the tab.
        <br>

      <div id="step2-11" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/s3-11.1.jpg','app/images/section3/s3-11.2.jpg'], this)">11.  Insert the medium (square) magnets into the square holes in the spring force magnet holder.  Snap the spring force magnet holder onto the mirror frame.  It should be centered over the coil and the small magnets on the acetate arrow.
    </div>
      <div id="step2-12" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/s3-12.1.jpg','app/images/section3/s3-12.2.jpg'], this)">12.  Insert the large (square) magnets into the square holes in the damper magnet holder.  Snap the damper magnet holder onto the mirror frame.  It should be centered over the aluminum cylinder on the acetate arrow.
    </div>
      <div id="step2-13" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/s3-13.jpg'], this)">13.  Peel the backing paper off of the mirror and mount the mirror to it’s spot on the acetate arrow.
    </div>
      <div id="step2-14" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/s3.jpg'], this)">14. Repeat steps 1-13 so that you have two.
