    <h3>Section 3 - Assembling the Thread Assembly</h3>
      <div id="step2-00" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/MA-12-1.jpg'], this)"><b>Description:</b> In this section you will be attaching the mirrors, magnets, and elastic thread to the a small plastic connector piece we call the acetate arrow.  These components when put together make up the moving parts of the Peachy Printerâ€™s galvonometers.
    </div>

    <div id="step2-01" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/parts-labelled.jpg'], this)"><b>For this section you will need:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Elastic thread - <b>Note:</b> the thread is wrapped around the plastic syringe.</li>
        <li>Carbon Rod</li>
        <li>2 Acetate Arrows - <b>Note:</b> This is a very small piece of plastic, there is no difference between the two arrows of the same colour, and your kit contains two sets of arrows (one clear one orange).  The orange has yet to be tested, so only use it in the case that you lose the clear arrows.
        </li>
        <li>The magnets (For this step we will be using the smaller magnets, but we find it is best to keep them stuck to the large magnets so they do not get lost.)</li>
        <li>2 Mirrors (Leave the protective film on the surface of the mirrors)</li>
        <li>Metal tweezers</li>
        <li>CA Glue</li>
      </ul>

    <div id="step2-1" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/MA-1-1.jpg'], this)">1. Take the acetate arrow and fold the magnet tab to a 90 degree angle, either way.
    </div>

    <div id="step2-2" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/default.png'], this)">2. Take 2 of the smaller magnets, and stack them, they will naturally want to do this.
    </div>

    <div id="step2-3" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/MA-3-1.jpg','app/images/section3/MA-3-2.jpg'], this)">3. Pinch the smaller magnets in between the tweezers tips. While doing so, use your fingernail to split the smaller magnets, making sure they are still aligned in a way they are attracted to each other, so that one magnet is on each tip of the tweezers.
    </div>

    <div id="step2-4" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/MA-4-1.jpg','app/images/section3/MA-4-2.jpg','app/images/section3/MA-4-3.jpg'], this)">4. Pinch the magnet tab between the magnets with the tweezers, slide the tweezers away while using your thumb and forefinger to hold the magnets in place. The magnets should remain on each side of the magnet tab, near the middle.
    </div>

    <div id="step2-5" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/MA-5-1.jpg'], this)">5. Put a small dab of CA glue onto the magnets so they are glued to the acetate arrow.
    </div>

    <div id="step2-6" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/MA-6-1.jpg','app/images/section3/MA-6-2.jpg'], this)">6. With the elastic thread, tie a knot (near the one end of the elastic thread) loosely so that there is a large loop, insert the carbon rod through the loop and then tighten the knot onto the rod. Once snug, pull on an end of the knot to make sure it will not come undone, if it does then re-tie it tighter.
    </div>
      <div id="step2-7" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/MA-7-1.jpg'], this)">7. Cut the short end of excess thread off about 1mm away from the carbon rod.
    </div>
      <div id="step2-8" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/MA-8-1.jpg','app/images/section3/MA-8-2.jpg'], this)">8. Cut the carbon rod to a length of about 4 mm, the knot should be in the middle of the piece you cut.
    </div>
      <div id="step2-9" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/MA-9-1.jpg'], this)">9. Cut the long end of the excess elastic thread to about 15 cm long (approximate).
    </div>
      <div id="step2-10" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/default.png'], this)">10. Repeat steps 6 - 8 so you have 2 of these.
    </div>
      <div id="step2-11" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/MA-11-1.jpg','app/images/section3/MA-11-2.jpg'], this)">11. Put the elastic thread through the hole on one end of the acetate arrow so that the carbon rod is on the opposite face as the magnets.
    </div>
      <div id="step2-12" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/MA-12-1.jpg'], this)">12. Take the second piece of elastic thread and put it through the hole on the other end of the arrow, so the carbon rod is on the opposite face as the magnets. We will now call this a thread assembly.
    </div>
      <div id="step2-13" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section4/MA-6-1.jpg'], this)">13. Remove the film from the back of the mirror and place the mirror onto its mounting spot on the acetate arrow so it is on the same side as the magnets. We will now call this a thread assembly.

    </div>
      <div id="step2-14" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/default.png'], this)">14. Repeat steps 1-13 so that you have two thread assemblies. 
    </div>
