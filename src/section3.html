    <h3>Section 3 - Assembling the Thread Assembly</h3>
      <div id="step2-00" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/MA-12-1.jpg'], this)"><b>Description:</b> In this section you will be attaching the mirrors, magnets, and elastic thread to the a small plastic connector piece we call the acetate arrow.  These components when put together make up the moving parts of the Peachy Printerâ€™s galvonometers.
    </div>

    <div id="step2-01" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/parts-labelled.jpg'], this)"><b>For this section you will need:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Elastic thread - <b>Note:</b> the thread is wrapped around the plastic syringe.</li>
        <li>2 Acetate Arrows - <b>Note:</b> This is a very small piece of plastic, there is no difference between the two arrows of the same colour, and your kit contains two sets of arrows (one clear one orange).  The orange has yet to be tested, so only use it in the case that you lose the clear arrows.
        </li>
        <li>The magnets (For this step we will be using the smaller magnets, but we find it is best to keep them stuck to the large magnets so they do not get lost.)</li>
        <li>2 Mirrors (Leave the protective film on the surface of the mirrors)</li>
        <li>Metal tweezers</li>
        <li>CA Glue</li>
      </ul>

    <div id="step2-1" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/s3-1.1.jpg','app/images/section3/s3-1.2.jpg'], this)">1. Take the acetate arrow and fold the magnet tab to a 90 degree angle, either way.
    </div>

    <div id="step2-2" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">2. Take 2 of the smaller magnets, and stack them, they will naturally want to do this.
    </div>

    <div id="step2-3" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/s3-3.1.jpg','app/images/section3/s3-3.2.jpg'], this)">3. Pinch the smaller magnets in between the tweezers tips. While doing so, use your fingernail to split the smaller magnets, making sure they are still aligned in a way they are attracted to each other, so that one magnet is on each tip of the tweezers.
    </div>

    <div id="step2-4" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/s3-4.1.jpg','app/images/section3/s3-4.2.jpg','app/images/section3/s3-4.3.jpg'], this)">4. Pinch the magnet tab between the magnets with the tweezers, slide the tweezers away while using your thumb and forefinger to hold the magnets in place. The magnets should remain on each side of the magnet tab, near the middle.
    </div>

    <div id="step2-5" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/s3-5.1.jpg'], this)">5. Put a small dab of CA glue onto the magnets so they are glued to the acetate arrow.
    </div>

    <div id="step2-6" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/s3-6.1.jpg','app/images/section3/s3-6.2.jpg','app/images/section3/s3-6.3.jpg'], this)">6. With the elastic thread, tie a knot (near one end of the thread) loosely so that there is a large loop, insert either of the the tie tabs at the end of the acetate arrow through the loop and then tighten the knot onto the tab.  Repeat this process so you have a double knot. Once snug, pull on an end of the knot to make sure it will not come undone, if it does then re-tie it tighter.
    </div>
      <div id="step2-7" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/s3-7.1.jpg'], this)">7. Cut the short end of excess thread off about 1mm away from the knot.
    </div>
      <div id="step2-8" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">8. Cut the long end of the excess elastic thread to about 15 cm long (approximate).
    </div>
      <div id="step2-9" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/s3-9.1.jpg'], this)">9. Pull the elastic thread through the hole beside the tie tab on one end of the acetate arrow, then fold the tie tab over so that it acts as a stopper that goes across the hole.  Make sure that you fold the tie tab over to the side opposite of the magnets.
    </div>
      <div id="step2-10" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/s3-10.1.jpg','app/images/section3/s3-10.2.jpg','app/images/section3/s3-10.3.jpg','app/images/section3/s3-10.4.jpg','app/images/section3/s3-10.5.jpg'], this)">10. Repeat steps 6 - 9 on the other side of the acetate arrow.
    </div>
      <div id="step2-11" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section3/s3-11.1.jpg'], this)">11. Remove the film from the back of the mirror, pull the elastic thread taught, and place the mirror onto its mounting spot on the acetate arrow so it is on the same side as the magnets. Make sure that the tie tab was folded to the opposite side the mirror goes on so that the mirror is not resting on it. We will now call this a thread assembly.
    </div>
      <div id="step2-12" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">12. Repeat steps 1-13 so that you have two thread assemblies.
    </div>
