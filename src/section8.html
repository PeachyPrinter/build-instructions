    <h3>Section 8 - Making the laser focus adjustable</h3>

    <div id="step7-00" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)"><b>Description:</b> In this section you will be taking apart the laser, adding an aperture disc, and ensuring that the lasers focus ring can indeed adjust the focus. 
<br>
        <br>
Unfortunately, due to the design of the lasers we ordered, the focus ring must be glued to the threaded lens housing to lock it in place. If this is not done, the focus ring will often just spin on the threaded lens housing rather than gripping it and spinning the lens housing further into or out of the laser body itself. 
<br>
        <br>
 Adding an aperture limits the amount of light and the size of the beam leaving the laser allowing us to print thin and properly cured walls.

    <div id="step7-01" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/parts-labelled.jpg'], this)">For this section you will need:
      <ul>
        <li>Laser</li>
        <li>Needle nose pliers</li>
        <li>The Laser Aperture Disc</li>
        <li>Pin</li>
        <li>Carbon rod (for a glue stick)</li>
        <li>CA Glue</li>
    </div>
    <p>Click to see an image of the parts labelled.</p>

    <div id="step7-1" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">1. Take your laser and remove the focus ring (the notched silver ring on the end) from the laser.
    </div>

    <div id="step7-2" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">2. Take the needle nose pliers and remove the threaded lens housing (the black ring that the focus ring threads on to) from the laser.
    </div>

    <div id="step7-3" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">3. Very carefully use a piece of carbon rod to dab glue around the edge of the threaded lens housing. Be sure that you donâ€™t get any glue on the lens itself. Place the laser aperture disc on top of the threaded lens housing so that it's centered over the lens. Allow the glue to dry before continuing.
    </div>

    <div id="step7-4" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">4. Use the pin to poke a hole directly in the center of the aperture disc.
    </div>
    <div id="step7-5" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">5. Screw the focus ring on no more than one full turn.  Apply glue to the point where the focus ring meets the threaded lens housing, securing the focus ring in place. Allow the glue to dry before continuing.
<br>
        <br>
<b>Note:</b> If the focus ring gets turned onto the threaded lens housing too far it will eliminate a portion of the lens travel distance necessary to achieve infinity focus.
    </div>
    <div id="step7-6" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">6. Screw the threaded lens housing and focus ring back into the laser body.
