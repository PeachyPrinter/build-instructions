    <h3>Section 8 - Adding a Laser Aperture</h3>

    <div id="step7-00" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)"><b>Description:</b>In this section you will be adding the laser aperture disc to your laser to limit the amount of light that exits the laser. 
<br>
        <br>
 Adding an aperture limits the amount of light and the size of the beam leaving the laser allowing us to print thin and properly cured walls.

    <div id="step7-1" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section8/s8-1.1.jpg'], this)">1.  Place the laser aperture disc of the lens on the front of the laser.  Position it so that the hole in the disc is centered on the laser.

    <div id="step7-2" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section8/s8-2.1.jpg','app/images/section8/s8-2.2.jpg'], this)">2. Place a drop of glue on the edge of the Aperture Disc, being careful not to move the disc at all.  Use your stick for applying glue to spread the glue all the way around the outer edge of the disc.  Make sure that the hole in the disc is centered on the laser and let the glue set.
