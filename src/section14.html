    <h3>Section 14 - Assembling the Drip system</h3>

    <div id="step16-00" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section14/DF-29A-1.jpg'], this)"><b>Description:</b> In this section you'll be assembling the drip system. The drip system uses a siphoning action to drip saltwater from the top reservoir into the bottom reservoir raising the height of the resin. The microphone cables will be hooked up to the pieces of aluminum rod so it can detect when a drip occurs. By counting the number of drips the Peachy Printer is able to know what height the resin is currently at, so it knows what layer to print. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Recommendation:</b> If using our standard setup, we recommend using a lower reservoir with a maximum height of 6 cm.  If you can’t find anything of that size, cutting the bottom of an empty and clean milk or cream container to that height is an easy solution.  While we realize that our recommendation provides you with a very small build volume, we strongly suggest that you use it as a starting point.  Using a standard system make troubleshooting much easier.  In addition, We've yet to test large prints.  For that reason it's a good idea to start with what we know works, and right now that is prints less than 4 cm tall.
<br>
        <br>
        <b>Note:</b> You must choose reservoirs that have the same distance from wall to wall all the way up (walls that are not tapered).  If the reservoir is larger at the top than it is at the bottom, larger at the bottom than it is at the top, or larger in the middle than it is at the top or bottom it will not work.  
<br>
        <br>
You also must make sure that your upper reservoir is no larger than your lower reservoir.  In fact, it’s best if it is somewhat smaller to ensure that your lower reservoir will never overflow.

    <div id="step16-1" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section14/s14-1.1.jpg','app/images/section14/s14-1.2.jpg'], this)">1. Take the Hollow Aluminum Rod and cut it in half using the utility knife (roll the rod back and forth while applying pressure with the knife). Make sure that the aluminum rod doesn’t get crushed when you cut it.
    </div>
    
    <div id="step16-2" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section14/s14-2.1.jpg'], this)">2. Take the rod with the closed end and file the points on both creased edges of the closed end. Once finished, the closed end should be no wider than the rest of the rod.
    </div>
    
    <div id="step16-3" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section14/s14-3.1.jpg','app/images/section14/s14-3.2.jpg'], this)">3. On the same piece of rod file nearly halfway through the aluminum rod creating a small hole positioned in the middle of the rod. Be careful not to bend the rod.
    </div>
    
    <div id="step16-4" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section14/s14-4.1.jpg'], this)">4. Disassemble the chopped syringe.  Take the black gasket off of the plunger.  Throw the plunger out, keep the gasket.
    </div>
    
    <div id="step16-5" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section14/s14-5.1.jpg'], this)">5. Cut two 1 cm pieces of neon tubing.
    </div>
    
    <div id="step16-6" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section14/s14-6.1.jpg','app/images/section14/s14-6.2.jpg','app/images/section14/s14-6.3.jpg'], this)">6. Take one of the pieces of neon tubing and push it over the small hole on the bottom of the syringe (the part where a needle would go).  Set the syringe aside.
    </div>
    
    <div id="step16-7" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section14/s14-7.1.jpg'], this)">7. Take the other 1 cm piece of neon tubing and push it into the black plunger gasket.
    </div>
    
    <div id="step16-8" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section14/s14-8.1.jpg','app/images/section14/s14-8.2.jpg'], this)">8. Take the Rod with 2 open ends and push it through the Neon Tubing in the black plunger gasket until the rod protrudes through the gasket about 1 cm.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Note:</b> We accidentally forgot to pre-poke a hole in some of the gaskets.  If you’re gasket doesn’t have a pre-poked hole then use a pin, tack or utility knife to poke a hole in the center of the peak of the gasket.
        <br>
        <br>
    </div>
    
    <div id="step16-9" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section14/s14-9.1.jpg','app/images/section14/s14-9.2.jpg','app/images/section14/s14-9.3.jpg'], this)">9. Take the Audio Jack and cut off one end, then strip about 4 inches off the end. Cut off the insulating thread.
    </div>
    
    <div id="step16-10" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section14/s14-10.1.jpg'], this)">10. Sand off the protective coating on the ends of all three wires, being careful not to break the wires.
    </div>

    <div id="step16-11" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section14/s14-11.1.jpg'], this)">11. Twist the sanded ends of the red and blue wires together.
    </div>

    <div id="step16-12" class="live"
         onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">12. Cut one 6 cm piece of neon tube and one 2 cm piece of neon tube.
    </div>

    <div id="step16-13" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section14/s14-13.1.jpg','app/images/section14/s14-13.2.jpg'], this)">13. Take the red and blue wires and insert it into the 6 cm piece of neon tubing.
    </div>

    <div id="step16-14" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section14/s14-14.1.jpg','app/images/section14/s14-14.2.jpg'], this)">14. Take the aluminum rod with the plunger on it and slide halfway into the 6 cm piece of neon tubing on the end opposite the plunger.  The wire should be pinched between the neon tube and the aluminum rod so that it can make an electrical connection.
    </div>

    <div id="step16-15" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section14/s14-15.1.jpg'], this)">15. Insert the Rod and Plunger into the large opening of the syringe.
    </div>

    <div id="step16-16" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section14/s14-16.1.jpg','app/images/section14/s14-16.2.jpg'], this)">16. Insert the sanded end of the remaining copper wire into the 3 cm piece of neon tube.  Slide open end of the aluminum rod that you filed down into the 3 cm piece of neon tubing.  The wire should be pinched between the neon tube and the aluminum rod so that it can make an electrical connection.
    </div>

    <div id="step16-17" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section14/s14-17.1.jpg','app/images/section14/s14-17.2.jpg','app/images/section14/s14-17.3.jpg','app/images/section14/s14-17.4.jpg'], this)">17. Push the closed end of the rod through the neon tubing at the bottom of the syringe until the hole you filed in the aluminum rod is inside the syringe.  Water needs to flow through this hole from within the syringe so it must not be blocked.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Note:</b> If the closed end of the rod doesn’t fit into the bottom of the syringe you might need to file the edges of the aluminum rod more to make it fit, but make sure it is still closed (water must not be able to get in the pinched end).
        <br>
        <br>
    </div>

    <div id="step16-18" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section14/s14-18.1.jpg'], this)">18. Gather your drinking straws, clear tubing, and upper and lower reservoirs.  The clear tubing must be able to fit inside the drinking straws, if it doesn’t you’ll need larger straws.  The straws will be glued to the upper and lower reservoirs to help route the hose on the drip feed.
    </div>

    <div id="step16-19" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section14/s14-19.1.jpg','app/images/section14/s14-19.2.jpg'], this)">19. Measure the depth of your upper reservoir and make note of it (you’ll need this measurement in another step later on). Cut a piece of a drinking straw to be 1 cm shorter than the measurement.  Glue this piece of straw to the inside wall of your upper reservoir so that it’s flush with the top edge.  There should be a 1 cm gap between the bottom of the straw and the bottom of the reservoir.
    </div>
    <div id="step16-20" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section14/s14-20.1.jpg'], this)">20. Cut another piece of straw to a length of 2 cm and glue it to the outside wall of the upper reservoir about 6 cm away from where you glued the straw on the inside.
    </div>
    <div id="step16-21" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">21. Repeat step 18 on the lower reservoir (the lower reservoir only needs a straw on the inside).
    </div>

    <div id="step16-22" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">22. You must now cut two sections of clear hose to make each end of your drip system reach into the upper and lower reservoirs. If you are sticking with our default printer setup, then follow step 23-A. If you are making your own custom reservoir setup, Follow step 23-B.
    </div>
    <div id="step16-23a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section14/s14-23a.1.jpg'], this)">23-A. Take the clear tubing and cut it to a length of 18 inches. Use your needle nose pliers to stretch one end so it’s easier to slide onto the neon tubing. Slide the clear hose over the neon tubing on the bottom of the syringe. Slide the other end of the clear hose down through the straw inside your lower reservoir.
    </div>
    <div id="step16-24a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section14/DF-27A-1.jpg','app/images/section14/DF-27A-2.jpg','app/images/section14/DF-27A-3.jpg'], this)">24-A. Multiply the depth of your upper reservoir by 2 and then add 12 cm.  Cut a piece of clear tubing to this length.
    </div>
    <div id="step16-25a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section14/s14-25a.1.jpg','app/images/section14/s14-25a.2.jpg'], this)">25-A. Use your needle nose pliers to stretch one end of the clear hose so it’s easier to slide onto the neon tubing. Slide the clear hose over the neon tubing on top aluminum rod coming out of the top of the syringe. Slide the other end of the clear hose up through the straw on the outside of your upper reservoir, and then down through the straw on the inside.  Make sure that there is no kink in the hose as it bends around between the two straws.
    </div>
    <div id="step16-26a" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">26-A. Put the cardboard piece labelled “top” on the cardboard stand, then place your upper reservoir on top. Your drip feed should now be hanging from the upper reservoir, and down into the lower one.
    </div>
    <div id="step16-23b" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">23-B. The length of these clear tubing sections will depend on the size of your upper and lower reservoirs, as well as the total distance between the two reservoirs. Cut them to the appropriate length. 
    </div>
    <div id="step16-24b" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">24-B. Use the needle nose pliers to stretch one opening on each section of clear hose.  Slide the stretched opening of each hose onto the neon tubing at both ends of the syringe.  Route the other ends of the clear hose through the straws you glued to your upper and lower reservoirs.
    </div>
    <div id="step16-25b" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">25-B. Place your upper reservoir on top of your stand, and your lower reservoir underneath your stand below the printer.  The drip feed should be connecting the two reservoirs so that salt water can syphon from the upper reservoir down into the lower reservoir.
