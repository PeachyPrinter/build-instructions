    <h3>Section 14 - Assembling the Internal Box</h3>

    <div id="step13-00" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section14/IB-2-3.jpg'], this)"><b>Description:</b> In this section you’ll be assembling the internal housing.  It serves as a mounting stand for the inner workings of the Peachy Printer.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Note:</b> The images for this section are very out of date, and many are missing. You’ll notice that the internal housing is made of cardboard, and is glued together.  This is of course no longer the case, however we left the images in as the pieces are still similar in other ways, and should be helpful regardless.
    </div>
    
    <div id="step13-01" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/parts-labelled.jpg'], this)"><b>For this section you will need:</b>
<br>
        <br>
        - The 3 Internal housing pieces (these will look similar to the external housing pieces, but - they are slightly smaller and have one tab on each piece)
        <br>
        - The Main Hanger with Laser Assembly attached
        <br>
        - Black duct tape (this is a temporary solution and will snap together in the future, duct tape is included in your kit)
        <br>
        <br>
        Click to see an image of the parts labelled.
        <br>
        <br>
    </div>

    <div id="step13-1" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg’], this)">1. Cut eight, 2 inch long sections of black duct tape.  Stick them to the edge of your table for later.
    </div>

    <div id="step13-2" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg’], this)">2. Take the widest of the 3 internal housing pieces and lay it down on your workspace so that the smooth side is facing up and the tab is at the top. 
    </div>
    <div id="step13-3" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg’], this)">3. Place one piece of tape on each of the 4 corners so that half of each piece of tape is hanging off the side edges. 
    </div>
    <div id="step13-4" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg’], this)">4. Stand the piece on it’s bottom edge so that the tab is pointing up. Rotate it 180 degrees so that the rough side of the plastic is facing towards you. This is going to be the back wall of the internal housing.
    </div>
    <div id="step13-5" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg’], this)">5. With your free hand grab one of the other internal housing pieces and butt it’s edge up against the front face of the back wall so that the rough side is facing inward, and the tab is pointing up and closest to the front edge.
    </div>
    <div id="step13-6" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg’], this)">6. Fold the extra tape sticking out off the back wall around the corner and onto the sidewall. Do this on both the top and the bottom pieces of tape. The two walls should now stand on their own.
    </div>
    <div id="step13-7" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section14/IB-1-1.jpg'], this)">7. Take the third and final internal housing piece and repeat steps 5 & 6. The internal housing should stand upright with the two side walls extending out at a 90 degree angle from the back wall, all the rough sides should be facing inwards, the tabs should be pointing up, and the two tabs on the sidewalls should be nearest the front edge.
    </div>
    <div id="step13-7" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section14/IB-2-1.jpg','app/images/section14/IB-2-3.jpg'], this)">8. Take the main hanger with the laser assembly attached and place it on top the internal housing so that the 3 tabs on the internal housing go through the 3 slots on the main hanger.
