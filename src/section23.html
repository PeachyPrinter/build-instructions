    <h3>Section 23 - Your First Print</h3>

        <div id="section23-00" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)"><b>Description:</b> Well done, you are ready to make your own print with the Peachy for the first time!
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Note:</b> There are no images for this section yet.</div>
        
    <div id="section23-01" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/parts-labelled.jpg'], this)"><b>For this section you will need:</b>
<br>
        <br>
        - The Peachy Printer with all cables connected to your computer with software installed, and upper and lower reservoirs with a drip feed.
        <br>
        - PeachyJuice or MakerJuice resin
        <br>
        - Safety glasses
        <br>
        - Wire mesh print base
        <br>
        - Needle nose pliers or tweezers
        <br>
        - Gcode to print
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Recommendation:</b> We strongly recommend that you chose a very simple object as your first print (a column, or a sphere).  We also strongly recommend that you print small (under 4 cm) until you've ran a few successful prints.  The reason for this is that if you do run into issues, you will find them and fix them much faster if your print only takes 5-10 minutes (as opposed to a print taking hours).

    <div id="section23-1" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">1. If you are continuing directly on from section 22 and still have your upper & lower reservoirs set up with a print base and resin, and the printer plugged into your computer then skip ahead to step 3.  If not, start with step 2.</div>
        
        <div id="section23-2" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">2. Remove your upper reservoir from the top of the external housing, and then remove the external housing.  Place your print base inside the lower reservoir - make sure the laser beam is hitting the center of the print base.  Add some salt water to the lower reservoir, then pour a small amount of resin on top of the salt water (just enough to completely cover the surface).  Be sure that the surface level of the resin does not get above the wire mesh of your print base.  You can now place the external housing back on, and the upper reservoir back on top of the printer.  Make sure that the drip feed still connects the two reservoirs.</div>
        
        <div id="section23-3" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">3. Open the terminal and change the directory to the source folder “peachy printer tools”, type <b>python gcode_wav_converter.py &quot;YourTuningFile.dat&quot; &quot;yourGcode.gcode&quot; &quot;out.wav&quot; &quot;out.cue&quot;</b> and press <b>Enter</b></div>
        
        <div id="section23-4" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">4. If you still have a full lower reservoir from the cure time calibration print you will need to syphon the salt water back into the upper reservoir.  You can do this by simply lifting the lower reservoir above the upper reservoir.  Once it's high enough, the syphon action will reverse, and flow into the upper reservoir. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Note:</b> The surface level of the resin must get below the level of the print base before starting a new print. It is best to leave between 5-10mm of saltwater in the lower reservoir at all times.  Make sure you don't suck any resin into the tubing of the drip feed as it will cure hard over time and clog your drip feed.  Also, in order to prevent the drip feed housing from filling right up with water, ensure that when you're siphoning back into the upper reservoir the drip feed housing is completely upside down.</div>
        
        <div id="section23-5" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">5. Open the drip valve and let the surface level of the resin rise. Close the valve off when the surface level of the resin is just below the wire mesh print base. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Note:</b> If the resin rises above the wire mesh print base, the print will not adhere to the base and your print will fail.</div>
        
        <div id="section23-6" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">6. Ensure that your microphone setting on the computer is set to 100% and your volume is also at 100%.</div>
        
        <div id="section23-7" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">7. From the command line type <b>python wav_player.py &quot;tuning.dat&quot; &quot;out.wav&quot; &quot;out.cue&quot;</b> and press <b>Enter</b></div>
        
        <div id="section23-8" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">8. Slowly turn on the drip valve and monitor the feedback on the screen.  The print will start automatically once the software detects the first drip.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Note:</b> You may not see the laser turn on right away, this is normal.  Drip slowly until the laser turns on.</div>
        
        <div id="section23-9" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">9. If you set the drip rate to fast, the software will give you the following warning: &quot;<b>Too fast:-------> X drips ahead</b>&quot;.  If this happens re-adjust the clamp ring valve on the drip feed until the warning stops appearing.</div>
        
        <div id="section23-10" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">10. You are now printing!  Watch and wait :) If the feedback in the terminal tells you you're dripping too fast, adjust the drip rate accordingly.</div>
        
        <div id="section23-11" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">11. The software will notify you when the print is complete. Remove the print from the lower reservoir by picking up the print base with a pair of tweezersor needle nosed pliers.</div>
        
        <div id="section23-12" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">12. If your print needs to be cured more, you can do so by exposing it to UV light.</div>
        
        <div id="section23-13" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">13. While wearing protective gloves, wash your print thoroughly with soap and warm water to remove any residue.</div>
