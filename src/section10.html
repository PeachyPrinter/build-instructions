    <h3>Section 10 - Mounting the Circuit</h3>

    <div id="step9-00" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section10/MC-5-3.jpg'], this)"><b>Description:</b> In this section you'll be attaching the circuit to its mounting plate, which in turn clips onto the L bracket.  The circuit mounting plate, along with the stand off also connects the L bracket to the main hanger (the piece that mounts the printer to its housing).
    </div>
    
    <div id="step9-01" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/parts-labelled.jpg'], this)"><b>For this section you will need:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Circuit</li>
        <li>Circuit mounting plate</li>
        <li>The L Bracket with Mirror Assemblies and Laser attached</li>
        <li>The Stand off</li>
        <li>2 small bolts</li>
        <li>2 small nuts</li>
        <li>Black adhesive foam strip</li>
        <li>Utility knife</li>
        <li>Small phillips head screwdriver</li>
        <p>Click to see an image of the parts labelled.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="step9-1" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">1. Cut the black adhesive foam strip into 4 equally sized pieces.
    </div>
    <div id="step9-2" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section10/s10-2.1.jpg'], this)">2. Remove the paper backing and stick 1 foam strip down diagonally across each corner near the mounting holes.
    </div>
    <div id="step9-3" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section10/s10-3.1.jpg'], this)">3. Hold the Circuit Mounting Plate so that the etchings are face down and and the arrow is pointing to the right. Then put the circuit down on top of the mounting plate so that the audio jack is positioned overtop of the arrow.
    </div>

    <div id="step9-4" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section10/s10-4.1.jpg','app/images/section10/s10-4.2.jpg'], this)">4. Insert 2 small bolts into diagonal holes on the Circuit so they go through the Circuit Mount. Thread the nuts onto the bolts so the Circuit is held on firmly. The head of the bolts should be on the Circuit(‘s) (side), the nuts on the Circuit(‘s) Mount (side).
    </div>

    <div id="step9-5" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section10/s10-5.1.jpg','app/images/section10/s10-5.2.jpg'], this)">5. Insert the circuit mounting plate onto the slot on the L Bracket so that arrow 5 points directly at the 5 on the snapping nub of the circuit mounting plate.
    </div>

    <div id="step9-6" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/section10/s10-6.1.jpg','app/images/section10/s10-6.2.jpg','app/images/section10/s10-6.3.jpg'], this)">6. Insert the Stand off arm into the L bracket so that arrow 6 points directly at the 6 on the snapping nub of the Stand off arm.
