    <h3>Section 21 - Cure Time Calibration Print
        <br>
        <br>
        Congratulations!  You're about to do your first actual print :)</h3>
        
        <div id="section21-00" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)"><b>Description:</b> In this step you'll find the ideal cure time (or laser speed). This is done by printing a corner and various speeds and then examining the print to determine the best cure time. If the laser moves too slowly, the resin gets exposed to too much light, resulting in a print that is overcured. Overcuring can cause a print to have very rough walls and sometimes even fail if the resin isn't able to break it’s surface tension quick enough.  The ideal settings will result in a print that is still somewhat soft or squishy.  You can then fully cure the printer at a later time by setting it out in sunlight, or by using a curing station. This process must be done each time that the laser is changed, or when using different resin formulas (stiff, flex, wiggle).

            <br>
<b>Note:</b> Printing with PeachyJuice or MakerJuice Flex and Wiggle resins remains untested, so we recommend completing this section using PeachyJuice Stiff or MakerJuice SubG/SubG+ resin only.  If you'd like to be a part of testing how the Peachy Printer performs with the Wiggle and Flex resins, there will be a subforum for that mission soon!

        <b>Safety Note:</b> You must wear your safety glasses at all times
Resin Warning: The resin is a mild skin irritant.  To be safe while handling resin we recommend that you use latex gloves. Be sure not to rub your face or eyes after handling the resin. The resin can get quite hot when exposed to direct sunlight, so be extra careful to keep it away from your skin under sunlight. If the resin is cured too quickly, prints can actually shatter due to the pressure and tension created by the shrinking outer layer of resin. Once the resin is fully cured, it becomes inert and is no longer an irritant.  Be sure to wash your fully cured print with soap and water before handling with your bare hands.

    <div id="section21-1" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">1. Open the terminal and change directory into the source folder (src) in the Peachy Printer Tools folder, type <b>python exposure_test.py</b> and press <b>Enter</b> 
        <br>
        This will generate gcode for your cure time calibration print.</div>
        
        <div id="section21-2" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">2. Convert the gcode you just generated to a wav file from the command line by typing <b>python gcode_wav_converter.py &quot;tuning.dat&quot; &quot;exposure_test.gcode&quot; &quot;out.wav&quot; &quot;out.cue&quot;</b> and pressing <b>Enter</b></div>
        
        <div id="section21-3" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">3. Remove your upper reservoir from the top of the external housing, and then remove the external housing.  Place your print base inside the lower reservoir,  Add some salt water to the lower reservoir, then add a small amount of resin on top of the salt water (just enough to completely cover the surface) by slowly pouring it down the side wall of the container (similar to how a beer would be poured).  Be sure that the surface level of the resin does not get above the wire mesh of your print base.   Put the lower reservoir inside the internal housing making sure the laser beam is hitting the center of the print base.You can now place the external housing back on, and the upper reservoir back on top of the printer.  Make sure that the drip feed still connects the two reservoirs.</div>
        
        <div id="section21-4" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">4. Open the drip valve and let the surface level of the resin rise. Close the valve off when the surface level of the resin is just below the wire mesh print base. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Note:</b> If the resin rises above the wire mesh print base, the print will not adhere to the base and your print will fail. This is because the laser light only cures approximately 0.1mm down into the resin.</div>
        
        <div id="section21-5" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">5. Ensure that your microphone setting on the computer is set to 100% and your volume is also at 100%.</div>
        
        <div id="section21-6" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">6. From the command line type <b>python wav_player.py &quot;Tuning.dat&quot; &quot;out.wav&quot; &quot;out.cue&quot;</b> and press <b>Enter</b></div>
        
        <div id="section21-7" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">7. Slowly turn on the drip valve and monitor the feedback on the screen.  The print will start automatically once the software detects the first drip.</div>
        
        <div id="section21-8" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">8. If you set the drip rate to fast, the software will give you the following warning: “<b>Too fast:-------> X drips ahead</b>”.  If this happens re-adjust the clamp ring valve on the drip feed until the warning stops appearing. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Note:</b> A print generally won't fail until the dripper is running 100-200 drips ahead.  In fact, it doesn’t hurt to have the drip rate running 5-25 drips ahead at all times.</div>
        
        <div id="section21-9" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">9. You are now printing!  Watch and wait :)</div>
        
        <div id="section21-10" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">10. The software will notify you when the print is completely. Stop the drip feed completely. Remove the print from the lower reservoir by picking up the print base with a pair of tweezers. Be careful not to expose it to UV light (sunlight, grow lights, tanning beds) until after you’ve completed all the steps in this section.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Safety Note:</b> Be sure that you are wearing protective gloves when handling a fresh print.  Once the print is fully cured, you can wash it thoroughly with soap and water, and then it is safe to handle with bare hands.</div>
        
        <div id="section21-11" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">11. Set the print down and poke along it from top to bottom.  You’ll notice that it’s cured hard on one end, and soft on the other.  The ideal cure rate or laser speed will have taken place at the hardest (most cured) point that is still smooth.  Make a mark at this point.</div>
        
        <div id="section21-12" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">12. Measure the distance from the bottom of the print to the mark you made and subtract 3 mm from your measurement.  To calculate your ideal laser speed in mm/second take your measurement, multiply it by 50, and add 100. For example, if your print is cured properly at a height of 10mm your calculation would be 10 * 50 + 100 = 600(mm/second).</div>
        
        <div id="section21-13" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg'], this)">13. Make note of this value as you will use it when generating your gcode. <b>Congratulations on your first print!</b></div>
