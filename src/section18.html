    <h3>Section 18 - Preparing for Calibration</h3>

        <div id="section18-00" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/default.png'], this)"><b>Description:</b> In this section you will be preparing to calibrate and tune your Peachy Printer. You will test to make sure your mirror assemblies are moving, you will mix up your saltwater solution and make a print base.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Note:</b> There are no images for this section yet.</div>
        
    <div id="section18-00" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/parts-labelled.jpg'], this)"><b>For this section you will need:</b>
<br>
        <br>
        - The two power cables
        <br>
        - The Audio cable
        <br>
        - The Peachy Printer
        <br>
        - A computer (with software installed)
        <br>
        - Wire mesh
        <br>
        - Water
        <br>
        - Large measuring cup
        <br>
        - Box of salt
        <br>
        - Safety glasses
        <br>
        <br>
        Click to see an image of the parts labelled.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Safety Note:</b> From this section on, you must wear your safety glasses at all times.
        <br>
        <br>
    </div>

    <div id="section18-1" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg’], this)">1. Put your safety glasses on. Remove the external housing, and dismount the main hanger from the internal housing.  Set it down on the main hanger.</div>
        <div id="section18-2" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg’], this)">2. Insert the red wire coming out of the back of the laser into Port 4 on the circuit.</div>
        <div id="section18-3" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg’], this)">3. Mount the main hanger back onto the internal housing. Connect the 2 power cables and the Audio jack to the ports on the circuit of the printer. Run them down and out the side. Place the calibration grid inside the Internal Housing directly beneath the Main Hanger. When you place the external housing back on, your cables should exit through the small notch cut at the bottom of the external housing.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Note:</b> It is best to use the standard USB ports on your computer, or a USB wall charger (for cellphones) to provide power to the printer.  These options are the most reliable power sources.  Stay away from USB hubs (unless plug into the wall) and USB ports on external monitors.
        </div>
        <div id="section18-4" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg’], this)">4. Ensuring that you're wearing the safety glasses, navigate to <b>where-you-saved-the-software/peachyprintertools/src</b> and run <b>calibrate-main.py</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Note:</b> If it doesn't open for you by double clicking, you may have to right click > open with python launcher.  You can also open it from the terminal.  To do that, <b>cd</b> (change directory) into the src folder of peachyprintertools and then type <b>python calibrate-main.py</b> and press <b>Enter</b></div>
        <div id="section18-5" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg’], this)">5. From the "shape" pull down menu, check that it is playing the “square” signal, and that laser power is checked to “on”. Take a close look at the mirrors, both mirrors should be slowly moving back and forth.  You should be able to see the laser beam moving around on the surface of your work area (it may not look like a true square yet but we will get to that later). If all these things are happening, well done!  This is a good sign your printer is working correctly.  If not, please go back to sections 11 and 12 to ensure that you've wired the coils, laser, and safety switch properly.  If you don't find the problem there, visit the beta tester forum for troubleshooting.

        <b>Note:</b> The Peachy Printer Team is on our <a href="http://forum.peachyprinter.com/" target="_blank">beta tester forum</a> ready to help, and since you’ve made it this far there might be other people who could use your help to!</div>
        <div id="section18-6" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg’], this)">6. Take your leftover clear hose and cut three pieces to a length of 2 cm. Insert the 3 tubes into the square hole in the wire mesh (as if they are legs of a tripod). This will be the base from which you print off of.  Set your print base aside. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Note:</b> You will want these pieces of hose to be as close to the same size as each other as possible so that your platform is even and does not wobble.  Don’t use a 4 leg system as it is much more prone to wobbling, and may result in failed prints.</div>
        <div id="section18-7" class="live" onclick="set_images(['app/images/noimage.jpg’], this)">7. Mix your saltwater solution with 3 parts water and 1 part salt. Stir until it is completely dissolved. Set the saltwater aside.
<br>
            <br>
            <b>Note:</b> In an ideal mixture the water should be almost completely saturated with salt, and the resin should easily float on top of it.
            <br>
            <br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> We recommend making some extra salt water and keeping it in a resealable container.  If you don’t have a resealable container then we recommend that you come back to this step when you get to Section 20, Part B - Calibrating the Drip Feed.</div>
